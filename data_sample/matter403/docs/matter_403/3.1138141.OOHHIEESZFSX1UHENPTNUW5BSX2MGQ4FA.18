General NPDES permit for construction activities conditionally approved in Arizona.  This can be used for both construction stormwater as well as hydrostatic test water discharge.

Applicant must send Notice of Intent (attached) once Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan completed.  NOI must be filed a minimum of 48 hours before construction begins.

Applicant must send Notice of Termination (attached) once storm water discharge completed and 70% of area re-stabilized.  

Applicant must avoid federally listed threatened and endangered species and critical habitat to obtain general permit.  See attached list of T&E by Arizona county.

Mr. Wilson stated that it would be very unlikely that an Individual Permit would be required unless applicant unable to meet historical site and T&E requirements.  Individual Permits may be very difficult to have approved.  

Mr. Wilson stated that he has no knowledge of any major opposition groups to such a project.
