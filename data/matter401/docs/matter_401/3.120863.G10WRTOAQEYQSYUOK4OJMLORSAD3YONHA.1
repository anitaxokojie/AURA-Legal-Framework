oday there is growing interest in distributed electricity 
generation, particularly onsite generation. This interest is 
stimulated by the reliability, power quality, and environmental 
needs of businesses and homeowners, as well as the availability 
of more efficient, environmentally-friendly, modular electric 
generation technologies, such as microturbines, fuel cells, 
photovoltaics, and small wind turbines. 
This report documents the difficulties faced by distributed 
generation projects seeking to connect with the electricity grid. 
The distributed generation industry has told us that removing these 
barriers is their highest priority. The case studies treated in this 
report clearly demonstrate that these barriers are real. They are, in 
part, an artifact of the present electricity industry institutional and 
regulatory structure which was designed for a vertically integrated 
utility industry relying on large central station generation. 
It is essential that energy and environmental policy reform accompany continued technological 
improvement in order to bring the many benefits of distributed power systems to our Nation. The 
challenge for us today, as the authors of this report suggest, is to seize the opportunity offered by 
the current restructuring of the electricity industry to create a new electricity system that supports, 
rather than stymies, distributed generation. 
We in the U.S. Department of Energyís Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy look 
forward to working with our many stakeholders in meeting this challenge.

Executive Summary 
Environmentally-friendly renewable energy 
technologies such as wind turbines and photovoltaics 
and clean, efficient, fossil-fuel technologies such as 
gas turbines and fuel cells are among the fleet of new 
generating technologies driving the demand for 
distributed generation of electricity. Combined heat 
and power systems at industrial plants or commercial 
buildings can be three times more efficient than 
conventional central generating stations. When 
facilities such as hospitals and businesses with 
computers or other critical electronic technology can 
get power from either the grid or their own 
generating equipment, energy reliability and security 
are greatly improved. 
Distributed power is modular electric generation or 
storage located close to the point of use. It can also 
include controllable load. This study focuses 
primarily on distributed generation projects. 
Distributed generation holds great promise for 
improving the electrical generation system for the 
United States in ways that strongly support the 
primary energy efficiency and renewable energy 
goals of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). 
Distributed generation offers customer benefits in the 
form of increased reliability, uninterruptible service, 
energy cost savings, and onsite efficiencies. Electric 
utility operations can also benefit. Smaller 
distributed-generation facilities can delay or 
eliminate the need to build new large central 
generating plants or transmission and distribution 
lines. They can also help smooth out peak demand 
patterns, reduce transmission losses, and improve 
quality of service to outlying areas. 
However, overlaying a network of small, non-utility 
owned (as well as utility-owned) generating facilities 
on a grid developed around centralized generation 
requires innovative approaches to managing and 
operating the utility distribution system, at a time 
when actual or anticipated deregulation has created 
great uncertainty that sometimes discourages 
adoption of new policies and practices. 
In December 1998, DOE sponsored a meeting of the 
stakeholders in distributed generation. The need to 
document the nature of the entry barriers for 
distributed power technologies became clear. 
Customers, vendors, and developers of these 
technologies cited interconnection barriersó           
including technical issues, institutional practices, and 
regulatory policiesóas the principal obstacles 
separating them from commercial markets. Industry 
and regulatory officials are also beginning to examine 
the nature and extent of these barriers and to debate 
the appropriate responses. 
This report reviews the barriers that distributed 
generators of electricity are encountering when 
attempting to interconnect to the electrical grid. The 
authors interviewed people who had previously 
sought or were currently seeking permission to 
interconnect. This study focuses on the perspective of 
the project proponents. No attempt was made to 
assess the prevalence of the barriers identified.∗ 
By contacting people known to be developing 
distributed generation projects or to be interested in 
these projects, and then gathering referrals from those 
people, the authors were able to identify 90 potential 
projects for this study. Telephone interviews were 
then conducted with people involved with those 90 
projects. For smaller projects, this was usually the 
customer or owner of the project. For larger projects, 
this was usually a distributed generation project 
developer building the facility for the customer. The 
authors obtained sufficient information about 65 of 
the 90 projects to develop full case studies for these 
projects. The sizes of the projects represented by the 
case studies range from 26 megawatts to less than a 
kilowatt. 
Most of the distributed power case studies 
experienced significant market entry barriers. Of the 
65 case studies, only 7 cases reported no major 
utility-related barriers and were completed and 
interconnected on a satisfactory timeline. For the 
remaining case studies, the project proponents 
expressed some degree of dissatisfaction in dealing 
with the utility. They believed that the utilitiesí 
policies or practices constituted unnecessary barriers                                   
∗ The purpose and value of the study was simply to 
confirm that barriers do exist, to provide illustrative 
examples of current case studies, and to initially identify 
the kinds of barriers. The authors made no attempt to 
obtain a statistically valid or unbiased sample. Also, the 
use of referrals to select case studies for identifying 
barriers likely skewed the selection toward cases where 
there were barriers.

Findings 
This report focuses on cases where barriers were present and does so from the project proponentsí 
perspective. Nonetheless, the study offers the following findings about current barriers to 
interconnection of distributed power generation projects.                                  
•  A variety of technical, business practice, and regulatory barriers discourage interconnection 
in the US domestic market.                  
•  These barriers sometimes prevent distributed generation projects from being developed.                                                               
•  The barriers exist for all distributed-generation technologies and in all regions of the 
country.  
•  Lengthy approval processes, project-specific equipment requirements, or high standard fees 
are particularly severe for smaller distributed generation projects.                                               
•  Many barriers in todayís marketplace occur because utilities have not previously dealt with 
small-project or customer-generator interconnection requests.                                            
•  There is no national consensus on technical standards for connecting equipment, necessary 
insurance, reasonable charges for activities related to connection, or agreement on 
appropriate charges or payments for distributed generation.                                        
•  Utilities often have the flexibility to remove or lessen barriers.                                             
•  Distributed generation project proponents faced with technical requirements, fees, or other 
burdensome barriers are often able to get those barriers removed or lessened by protesting 
to the utility, to the utilityís regulatory agency, or to other public agencies. However, this 
usually requires considerable time, effort, and resources.                                       
•  Official judicial or regulatory appeals were often seen as too costly for relatively smallscale 
distributed generation projects.                        
•  Distributed generation project proponents frequently felt that existing rules did not give 
them appropriate credit for the contributions they make to meeting power demand, reducing 
transmission losses, or improving environmental quality. 
to interconnection. As of completion of the report, 29 
of the case study projects had been completed and 
interconnected; 9 were meeting only the customerís 
load and were not sending any power to the grid; 2 
had disconnected from the grid; 7 had been installed, 
but were still seeking interconnection (and may be 
operating independently in the interim); 13 were 
pending; and 5 projects had been abandoned. 
For purposes of this analysis, the barriers 
encountered in the case studies were classified as 
technical, business practice, or regulatory. 
Technical barriers consist principally of utility 
requirements to ensure engineering compatibility of 
interconnected generators with the grid and its 
operation. Most significant of the technical barriers 
are requirements for protective equipment and safety 
measures intended to avoid hazards to utility property 
and personnel, and to the quality of power in the 
system. Proponents of potential distributed            
generation systems often stated that the required 
equipment and custom engineering analyses are 
unnecessarily costly and duplicative. Such 
requirements added $1200 or 15% to the cost of a 
0.9 kW photovoltaics project, for example, plus an 
additional $125 per year for relay calibration. Newer 
generating equipment already incorporates 
technology designed specifically to address safety, 
reliability, and power-quality concerns. 
Business-practice barriers arise from contractual and 
procedural requirements for interconnection and, 
often times, from the simple difficulty of finding 
someone within a utility who is familiar with the 
issues and authorized to act on the utilityís behalf. 
This lack of utility experience in dealing with such 
issues may be one of the most widespread and 
significant barriers to distributed generation, 
particularly for small projects. Utilities that set up 
standard procedures and designate a point of contact 
for distributed generation projects considerably 
iii 
simplify and reduce the cost of the interconnection 
process both for themselves and for the distributed 
generation project proponents. 
Other significant business-practice barriers included 
procedures for approving interconnection, application 
and interconnection fees, insurance requirements, and 
operational requirements. Many project proponents 
complained about the length of time required for 
getting projects approved. Seventeen projectsómore 
than 25% of the case studiesóexperienced delays 
greater than 4 months. Smaller projects often faced a 
lack of uniform standards, procedures, and 
designated utility points of contact for determining a 
particular utilityís technical requirements and review 
processes. This led to prohibitively long and costly 
approvals. Proponents of larger projects sometimes 
formed the perception that the utility was deliberately 
dragging out negotiations. Application and 
interconnection fees were frequently viewed as 
arbitrary and, particularly for smaller projects, 
disproportionate. Utility-imposed operational 
requirements sometimes resulted in direct conflicts 
between utility and customer needs. For example, 
utilities often ask to control the facility so that, 
among other things, they can shut down the facility 
for safety purposes during power outages. This 
requirement would preclude the customer using the 
facility for emergency backup poweróa key 
advantage of distributed generation. 
Regulatory barriers were principally posed by the 
tariff structures applicable to customers who add 
distributed generation facilities, but included outright 
prohibition of ìparallel operationîóthat is, any use 
other than emergency backup when disconnected 
from the grid. The tariff issues included charges and 
payments by the utility and how the benefits and 
costs of distributed generation should be measured 
and allocated. Also, several project proponents 
reported being offered substantial discounts on their 
electrical service from the utility as an inducement 
not to build their planned distributed generation 
facilities. 
Backup or standby charges were the most frequently 
cited rate-related barrier. Unless distributed 
generation customers want to disconnect completely 
from the grid and invest in the additional equipment 
needed for emergency backup and peak needs, they 
will be depending on the utility to augment their 
onsite power generation. This is a principal reason for   
interconnection, but it can also impose a burden on 
the utility because it may be required to maintain 
otherwise unnecessary capacity to meet the 
distributed generation customersí occasional added 
demand. Charges for these services varied widely. 
Standby charges ranged from $53.34/kW-yr to 
$200/kW-yr for just the case study projects located in 
the state of New York, for example. Project 
proponents often felt that the charges were excessive 
and that utility concerns could be addressed through 
scheduling and other procedures. Other frequently 
disputed charges included transmission and 
distribution demand charges and exit fees (charges to 
disconnecting customers that will no longer be 
supporting the payoff of the utilityís sunk or 
ìstrandedî cost in generation equipment). 
Furthermore, the charges imposed often do not reflect 
the benefits to the grid the distributed generation 
might provide. 
For small customers, net metering (where the meter 
runs backwards when power is being contributed to 
the gridóprescribed by law in about 30 states) 
provides credit at the retail rate. For large distributed 
generation facilities, however, the typically muchlower 
wholesale rate paid (or uplift charge assessed 
for using transmission and distribution systems to sell 
power to third parties in deregulated states) was often 
seen as unfair, especially if no credit was given for 
on-peak production. Project proponents felt that 
utilities were not giving them credit for their 
contribution to helping meet peak demands. 
Environmental permitting was not a focus of this 
report, but many project proponents did cite it as a 
regulatory barrier. Inconsistent requirements from 
state to state and site to site were frequently listed as 
barriers. The length of time and cost of testing to 
comply with air quality standards was often seen as 
burdensome and unfair. Proponents also felt that 
permitting processes should give credit for the 
replacement of older, more polluting, facilities by the 
distributed generation projects (e.g. a gas turbine 
instead of a central station coal-fired plant) as well as 
the increased efficiencies, for example, of a 
combined heat and power facility. 
The case studies identified a wide range of barriers to 
grid interconnection of distributed generation 
projects. These barriers unnecessarily delay and 
increase the cost of what otherwise appear to be 
viable projects with potential benefits to both the 
iv 
customer and the utility system. They sometimes 
even kill projects. There are, however, several 
promising trends. Uniform technical standards for 
interconnection are being developed by the Institute 
of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. Individual 
state regulatory agencies are adopting rules to address 
barriers to distributed generation. In 1999, the New 
York and Texas public utility commissions adopted 
landmark rules on interconnection, and ambitious 
proceedings on distributed generation are now 
underway in California. Individual utilities have 
adopted programs to promote distributed generation. 
These trends indicate the potential for resolution of 
barriers to interconnection of distributed generation 
projects. 
Much more must be done in order to create a 
regulatory, policy, and business environment which 
does not create artificial market barriers to distributed 
generation. The barriers distributed generation 
projects face today go beyond the problems of 
technical interconnection standards or process delay, 
which are more immediately apparent to the market. 
They grow out of long-standing regulatory policies 
and incentives designed to support monopoly supply 
and average system costs for all ratepayers. 
In the present regulatory environment, utilities have 
little or no incentive to encourage distributed power. 
To the contrary, regulatory incentives drive the 
distribution utility to defend the monopoly against 
market entry by distributed power technologies. 
Revenues based on throughput and system average 
pricing are optimized by keeping maximum loads and 
highest revenue customers on the system. But, as in 
any competitive market, those are the customers that 
gain the most by switching to new, more economic, 
efficient, or customized power alternatives. In 
addition, current tariffs and rate design as a rule do 
not price distribution services to account for system 
benefits that could be provided by distributed 
generation. 
Resolution on a state-by-state basis will not address 
what may be the biggest barrier for distributed 
generationóa patchwork of rules and regulations 
which defeat the economies of mass production that 
are natural to these small modular technologies. 
Although regulatory proceedings and legal challenges 
eventually would resolve most of the identified 
barriers, national collaborative efforts among all 
stakeholders are necessary to accelerate this process     
so that near-term emerging markets for the new 
distributed generation technologies are not stymied. 
Distributed generation promises greater customer 
choice, efficiency advantages, improved reliability, 
and environmental benefits. Removing artificial 
barriers to interconnection is a critical step toward 
allowing distributed generation to fulfill this promise 
A Ten-Point Action Plan For 
Reducing Barriers to Distributed 
Generation 
Reduce Technical Barriers 
(1) Adopt uniform technical standards for 
interconnecting distributed power to the grid. 
(2) Adopt testing and certification procedures for 
interconnection equipment. 
(3) Accelerate development of distributed power 
control technology and systems. 
Reduce Business Practice Barriers 
(4) Adopt standard commercial practices for any 
required utility review of interconnection. 
(5) Establish standard business terms for 
interconnection agreements. 
(6) Develop tools for utilities to assess the value 
and impact of distributed power at any point 
on the grid. 
Reduce Regulatory Barriers 
(7) Develop new regulatory principles compatible 
with distributed power choices in both competitive 
and utility markets. 
(8) Adopt regulatory tariffs and utility incentives to fit 
the new distributed power model. 
(9) Establish expedited dispute resolution processes 
for distributed generation project proposals. 
(10) Define the conditions necessary for a right to 
interco n nect.

SECTION 1. INTRODUCTION AND METHODOLOGY 
1.1 Introduction 
Distributed power is modular electric generation or 
storage located close to the point of use. It can also 
include controllable load. This study focuses 
primarily on distributed generation projects. The 
sizes of the projects described in this report ranged 
from 26 megawatts to less than a kilowatt. 
The convergence of competition in the electric 
industry with the arrival of environmentally friendly 
microturbines, fuel cells, photovoltaics, small wind 
turbines, and other advanced distributed power 
technologies has sparked strong interest in distributed 
power, particularly in on-site generation. This 
convergence of policy and technology could radically 
transform the electric power system as we know it 
today. Like the revolution that took us from 
mainframe computers to PCís, this transformation 
could take us from a power system that relies 
primarily on large central station generation to one in 
which small electric power plants located in our 
homes, office buildings, and factories provide most 
of the electricity we use. The resulting major 
improvement in electric power reliability could save 
billions of dollars now lost each year because of 
power disruptions. The impressive efficiency and 
environmental gains offered by distributed power 
technologies have the potential to contribute 
significantly to mitigation of air pollution and global 
climate change. However, these distributed power 
technologies face an array of market entry barriers, 
which are the subject of this report. 
At a Department of Energy (DOE) meeting of 
industry and public stakeholders in December 1998, 
the need to document the nature of the entry barriers 
for distributed power technologies became clear. 
Customers, vendors, and developers of these 
technologies cited interconnection barriers, including 
technical and related institutional and regulatory 
practices, as the principal obstacles separating them 
from commercial markets. As witnessed by the 
landmark rules adopted in 1999 by the New York and 
Texas public utility commissions, and the ambitious 
proceedings taking place in California, industry and 
regulatory officials are beginning to examine the        
nature and extent of these barriers, and to debate the 
appropriate response. 
This study serves to document the reality of market 
entry barriers across the spectrum of distributed 
power technologies by providing case studies of 
distributed power projects that have been impacted 
by these market barriers. However, the focus is on 
barriers to interconnection with utility systems, and 
other important issues such as environmental 
permitting are not examined in detail in this report. 
1.2 Methodology 
Identifying Case Studies 
The first challenge of the study was to identify gridconnected 
distributed power projects that would 
serve as subjects for the case studies. Representatives 
from trade associations, equipment manufacturers, 
distributed power project developers, utilities, utility 
regulators, state energy officials, and others in the 
distributed power industry were asked to identify 
projects that might be candidate case studies. Case 
study contacts also identified other possible case 
studies. Altogether more than 150 individuals were 
contacted during the course of this project. 
These contacts identified more than 90 possible 
projects covering a broad range of fuel types, 
technologies, and sizes. For smaller projects, the 
information source was typically the project 
owner/electricity customer. For larger projects, it was 
typically a project developer. In a few cases, the 
equipment manufacturer was the source. The projects 
varied from those in the planning stages to those that 
were already in operation. Also included were 
projects that ultimately did not interconnect with the 
utilityís grid or which were abandoned. Many of the 
projects were in the process of negotiation with the 
utilities for final interconnection. Some of projects 
were not included in this report because of a lack of 
complete or reliable information. Of the 90 projects, 
sufficient information was collected on 65 to treat 
them as case studies. The findings and analyses of 
this report are based on these 65 case studies.

NOTE: Given the scope of this project and the 
manner of locating the distributed power cases 
discussed, no claims are made as to the likelihood 
that the cases represent any particular scale of 
problem, nor that the categories in which we have 
placed individual cases are statistically valid in any 
formal sense. Rather, the cases report situations 
encountered in the marketplace today and convey, 
where available, the participantís suggestions about 
how to correct situations that hindered distributed 
power development. 
Conducting Interviews 
With assistance from the DOE and other distributed 
resource experts, an interview survey form (inserted 
on pages 3-4) was designed and used to document the 
65 case studies that form the basis of this report.1 
Using this survey form to guide the conversation, we 
interviewed project information sources by 
telephone. The completed form was then E-mailed or 
faxed to the interviewee for verification when 
possible. Of the 65 case studies, we selected 26 as 
being representative of the barriers encountered and 
having sufficient information available to tell an 
illustrative story. These 26 cases are presented in 
detail in Section 3 of this report. To respect 
confidentiality concerns and to avoid undue emphasis 
on the specifics of any single case study, the names 
of distributed power owners, specific facility 
locations, equipment vendors, and interconnecting 
utilities are excluded from the case study narratives. 
This report focuses on the nature and scope of 
interconnection barriers in the U.S domestic market, 
rather than practices of any particular utility or 
stakeholder. 
Utility Verification 
For each of the 26 projects detailed in Section 3, the 
interconnecting utility was contactedófirst to 
1 The authors thank Joseph Galdo, Program Manager, 
Office of Power Technologies, and Richard DeBlasio and 
Gary Nakarado of the National Renewable Energy 
Laboratory for their leadership in setting up this study. Joe 
Iannucci of Distributed Utility Associates was the most 
notably included of several experts who played key roles 
in the conceptualization, organization, and review of this 
study. Our biggest thanks, however, go to the many 
projects developers, owners, and utilities who participated 
in the survey and follow-up interviews.                    
validate information provided by the owners or 
developers, and second to document the utilityís 
opinions and recommendations. In instances where 
the project developer or owner desired to remain 
anonymous, the details of these projects were not 
discussed with the utility. Instead, generic questions 
regarding the utilityís distributed power practices 
were asked to compare and confirm the utilityís 
position as reported by the project owner or 
developer. In addition, tariff information and copies 
of interconnection procedures and applications were 
requested. In some cases, there was no response from 
the utility. Thus, these case studies primarily 
represent the developersí views of the situations they 
encountered in seeking to interconnect these 
facilities. Therefore, the cases reported here may not 
reflect what might be a very different utility position 
with respect to some of the cases. (See additional 
discussion at introductory discussion of case studies.) 
Throughout this document, ìthe utilityî typically 
refers to the utility responsible for the distribution 
system with which the distributed generation 
installation sought to interconnect. This includes 
investor-owned utilities (IOUs), municipals, and 
cooperatives. In some cases, it may refer to a 
generation and transmission (G&T) utility that placed 
restrictions on the distribution utility. 
Analyzing and Synthesizing Data 
Finally, an attempt was made to summarize the 
barriers encountered in the case studies and 
demonstrate the real impact these barriers can have 
on a distributed power project. Section 2 includes the 
summary and analysis of the barriers represented in 
the case studies. Section 2.5 is an initial attempt at 
quantifying the barrier-related costs of 
interconnection. Section 2.6 presents findings and 
conclusions, including suggested actions for reducing 
barriers. Section 3 provides narrative descriptions of 
26 of the individual case studies.

SECTION 2 SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS 
OF INTERCONNECTION BARRIERS 
2.1 The Barriers Reported 
Most of the distributed generation case studies 
experienced significant market entry barriers. Seven 
of the 65 projects did not experience significant 
barriers and reported uneventful and timely 
completion of the installation. Those less-typical 
examples of ìbarrier-freeî development may provide 
instructive models for interconnection policy and 
practice that allow access to commercial markets for 
these technologies. 
For purposes of this initial analysis, the barriers 
encountered in the case studies were classified into 
the following three types:              
•  Technical Barriers. Technical interconnection 
barriers include utility requirements intended to 
address engineering compatibility with the grid 
and grid operation. These barriers include 
specifications relating to power quality, dispatch, 
safety, reliability, metering, local distribution 
system operation, and control. Examples include 
engineering reviews, design criteria, engineering 
and feasibility studies, operating limits, and 
technical inspections required by distribution 
utilities. Technical barriers are described in 
Section 2.2.        
•  Business Practice Barriers. Business practice 
barriers relate to the contractual and procedural 
requirements for interconnection. Examples 
include contract length and complexity, contract 
terms and conditions, application fees, insurance 
and indemnification requirements, necessity for 
attorney involvement, identification of an 
authorized utility contact, consistency of 
requirements, operational requirements, timely 
response, and delays. Business practice barriers 
are described in Section 2.3.                     
•  Regulatory Barriers. Regulatory barriers include 
matters of policy that fall within the jurisdiction 
of state utility regulatory commissions or the           
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). 
These are issues that arise from or are governed 
by statutes, policies, tariffs, or regulatory filings 
by utilities, which are approved by the regulatory 
authority. Regulatory prohibition of 
interconnection, unreasonable backup and 
standby tariffs, local distribution system access 
pricing issues, transmission and distribution tariff 
constraints, independent system operators (ISO) 
requirements, exit fees, ìanti-bypassî rate 
discounting, and environmental permitting were 
put into this category. Regulatory barriers are 
described in Section 2.4. 
These categories of barriers are for convenience of 
description and analysis only. In other forums, these 
barriers have been classified in other ways. Quite 
often, the division is simply technical versus nontechnical 
barriers. In many cases, the barrier 
described as being in one category could easily have 
been classified as being in another, because technical, 
regulatory and business issues are interrelated. 
Selection of a particular category was based on the 
perspective of the project owners or developers who 
were interviewed or on the judgment of the authors of 
this report.2 
Figure 2-1 provides a comparison of the percentage 
of case studies effected by each category of barrier. A 
2 It could be argued that, at least in the case of regulated 
utilities, virtually all of the barriers that we have termed 
business practice barriers are regulatory, because the 
regulatory system has the jurisdictional authority to 
address the issues raised. The recent actions of state 
regulatory authorities in Texas and New York further blur 
the line of our distinction. They set forth the circumstances 
in which certain business practices may be utilized and 
prescribe the terms and forms of contracts. Many business 
practice issues nonetheless appear from these case studies 
to attract little regulatory attention. On the other hand, 
many of the regulatory issues or business practices are 
based on technical issues. In some cases, resolution of 
these technical issues may facilitate a regulatory solution 
or indicate that a particular business practice could be 
changed without detriment to the power system. 
6 
majority of reported cases encountered barriers in 
each of the three categories, with nearly two-thirds 
reporting business practice barriers and more than 
half reporting technical or regulatory barriers. 
Given the anecdotal nature of these case studies and 
the relatively small sample of cases, no significance 
beyond the notional is intended with respect to the 
classification of barriers in one or the other of the 
three categories. However, any of the three categories 
of barriers can severely impact or kill a project. 
Consequently, any strategy to mitigate the barriers to 
distributed power that addresses only one or two of 
these will not be completely successful in opening 
markets to these technologies. A successful strategy 
must address all three: technical, regulatory and 
business practice barriers. 
Table 2-1 indicates the severity of impact a category 
of barrier had on individual projects. It also shows 
that the issues are not limited to a few jurisdictionsó 
18 states are represented in the case studies. The 
barriers also cut across technologies and can be 
important for 2-kW projects as well as for 20-MW 
projects. 
In response to what they believed to be unreasonable 
utility opposition to on-site power, one large 
commercial facility identified in this study chose to 
sever the connection with the grid altogether. 
Another project has no choice but to disconnect when    
its peak shaving generator is in operation. Others are 
still attempting to interconnect but may indeed decide 
to also operate independent of the utility system. 
They did not want to forgo the economic and 
reliability advantages of on-site combined heat and 
power facilities. These decisions followed long 
efforts to obtain optimal combined on-site and grid 
power arrangements. Some distributed power 
suppliers are finding it more economical to provide 
their own backup and standby generation on-site as 
well.3 
2.2 Technical Barriers 
Many of the technical barriers to distributed power 
relate to the utilityís responsibility to maintain the 
reliability, safety, and power quality of the electric 
power system. Typical technical barriers encountered 
in the case studies are interconnection requirements 
that the utility may unnecessarily require to ensure 
reliability, safety, and power quality. These may 
include: 
•  Requirements for protective relays and transfer 
switches  
•  Power quality requirements             
•  Power flow studies and other engineering 
analyses.

Safety Standards 
The principal safety concern among utilities with 
respect to connecting generation equipment to the 
grid is protection against ìislanding,î the condition 
where a generating facility continues to supply power 
to a portion of the grid when the balance of grid has 
been de-energized (during a power outage, for 
example).4 This condition is of concern in two 
scenarios: where the distributed generator is either 
ìfeeding a short circuitî thus potentially causing a 
fire, and where a lineman might mistakenly come in 
contact with what is otherwise thought to be a deenergized 
line. 
Traditionally, utilities protected against islanding by 
using mechanical relays and transfer switches that 
automatically isolated generating facilities from the 
grid, whether these facilities were utility-owned or 
non-utility owned. This equipment is effective and 
reasonably efficient, but is prohibitively expensive 
for small-scale distributed generators. 
However, continuing innovations in power 
electronics have resulted in the development of 
relatively inexpensive electronic circuitry that 
provides effective anti-islanding protection. The 
traditional protective relays and other anti-islanding 
equipment were separately engineered and installed 
at a substantial cost to the generator. The newer 
electronic circuitry can be integrated into inverter 
components of the distributed generating facility at 
substantially lower cost. This circuitry can be 
programmed to shut down when there is no line 
voltage detected from the utility. This new equipment 
has been operating for more than a decade 
(particularly in PV applications) without any reports 
4 As distributed power technologies have begun to make 
community-scale systems technically and economically 
feasible, the advantages and enhanced reliability of 
islanding are beginning to be explored. Keeping a 
community or facilityís lights on, when neighboring 
communities or facilities are out is not only an economic 
advantage but a public health and safety advantage as well. 
Nonetheless, utilities often continue to view the potential 
for energizing an otherwise de-energized line as a safety 
risk to line workers, the public and property. The risk, as 
stated, is that a person could come into contact with a 
utility line thinking it is de-energized when it is not.          
of islanding-related problems.5 Moreover, 
Underwriters Laboratories (UL) has developed and 
approved a functional test for the anti-islanding 
circuitry for the inverter technology used in small 
photovoltaic and wind energy applications. The UL is 
also expected to develop comparable standards for all 
distributed generating technologies in coming years, 
as part of a parallel effort with the Institute of 
Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) to 
develop interconnection standards for the broader 
category of distributed generators. Developers have 
suggested that there is a need to develop modeling 
tools and educational material for utility distribution 
to engineers so that they can expedite their review of 
these issues. 
Nevertheless, a number of the case studies indicate 
that utilities remain reluctant to accept the protection 
circuitry built into the distributed generating facilities 
as an alternative to separate protective relays and 
other anti-islanding equipment. For example, the 
owner of a 0.9-kW PV system in New Hampshire 
was required by the utility to install separate 
protective relays even though the PV systemís 
inverter included over/under voltage and over/under 
frequency protection, as well as anti-islanding 
protection. According to this distributed generator, 
the utilityís justification was that it was unfamiliar 
with the inverter and preferred to use equipment with 
which it was more comfortable. The installation of 
the relays, however, cost the customer $600 
(approximately $660/kW) and increased the cost of 
the system by approximately eight percent. In 
addition, the utility required the customer to have the 
relays calibrated annually, imposing a recurring cost 
of $125 per year that offsets nearly 65 percent of the 
annual energy output from the PV system.6 
Another case involved 140-kW reciprocating-naturalgas-engine-generators 
installed in Colorado. The 
utility required a multi-function solid-state relay 
package that cost the project developer an additional 
$3,000 for relays, which were redundant to those

already included in the multi-function 
interconnection package installed.7 
Other case study respondents reported similar 
problems with protective relay requirements that 
appeared redundant to the distributed power 
developers, given the protection functions built into 
the generating facilities. For instance, the developers 
of a 132-kW photovoltaic system in Northern 
California reported that the interconnecting utility 
initially requested a separate package of pre-qualified 
or tested protective relays costing between $25,000 
and $35,000, even though the inverters installed with 
the system incorporated the protective functions that 
the utility wanted. The utility eventually dropped this 
requirement.8 
Another aspect of utility safety is a frequent 
requirement that a utility perform its own tests on 
equipment with which it has no experience. This 
separate utility testing requirement can add 
significant cost and delay to a project, especially 
from the vendors viewpoint. Vendors see each 
separate utility performing similar tests as an 
unnecessary major barrier and would like to see 
prequalification or certification procedures 
established. 
Power Quality Standards 
Power quality concerns include voltage and 
frequency disturbances, voltage flicker, and 
waveform distortion. Distributed power facilities, like 
central-station facilities, can have either a detrimental 
or a beneficial effect on power quality. 
As with the modern electronic approaches that can 
provide islanding protection, innovation in power 
electronics is revolutionizing the way that power 
quality concerns are addressed. Traditionally, utilities 
required the installation of over/under voltage and 
over/under frequency relays and other, separate, 
protective devices to ensure that power quality 
requirements were being met. Today, many 
7 Case #12. 
8 Case #13.                                          
distributed generators have built-in functionality 
that meets the most stringent of power quality 
requirements. For example, IEEE Standard 519-1992, 
entitled ìRecommended Practices and Requirements 
for Harmonic Control in Electrical Power Systems,î 
has become the reference standard with respect to 
power quality concerns. This is the standard to which 
inverter manufacturers generally design their 
products. 
The principal problem facing distributed generators 
with respect to power quality issues is the same as 
with anti-islanding protection. Lacking experience 
with the newer technologies or standardized testing 
procedures, utilities so far have been reluctant to 
accept the power quality protection built into 
distributed generating facilities. Instead, they have 
sought to require the use of traditional, utilityapproved 
equipment instead. 
Local Distribution System Capacity 
Constraints 
The general approach among utilities in dealing with 
local distribution system capacity constraints is to 
conduct pre-interconnection studies before 
interconnecting distributed generators. These studies 
evaluate the potential effects of the distributed 
generating facility on the specific portion of utility 
system to be affected, and determine whether any 
upgrades or other changes are needed to 
accommodate the generating facility. The cost of 
these studies usually is passed on to the distributed 
generator. This practice is often blessed by the 
regulatory bodies under the ìuser paysî principle. 
However, equivalent studies for new loads that may 
be of equal size and impact on facilities may be 
addressed quite differently under long-established 
service tariffs. 
9 
9 Distribution system engineering has been referred to as 
an ìart, not a science.î While not all engineers would 
agree, there is agreement that there are many more 
variables in distribution engineering than designing 
transmission. This complexity can lead to a variety of 
solutions by utilities , thus making standardization of 
distributed utility solutions more difficult. 
11 
The following case histories identified the cost and 
delay of pre-interconnection studies as a significant 
barrier to interconnection of their distributed 
generating facilities:       
•  A 0.9-kW PV system in New Hampshire that 
paid $600 for an interconnection study 
($667/kW)10  
•  A 3-kW PV system in New Hampshire where the 
customer refused to pay $1,000 for an 
interconnection study ($333/kW)11                    
•  A 703-kW cogeneration facility in Maryland 
where the customer paid $40,000 and lost several 
months of project time to design engineering 
review standards subsequently abandoned by the 
utility.12 
New York and Texas recently addressed the conflict 
between a utilityís interest in conducting 
interconnection studies and a distributed generatorís 
interest in limiting the scope and cost of such studies. 
These two states, however, have taken different 
approaches. 
In New York, the Public Service Commission 
adopted a rule on December 31, 1999,13 that states 
that interconnection studies shall not be required for 
facilities under 10-kW. Also, studies may not be 
required for facilities up to 50-kW interconnected on 
a single-phase line, or up to 150-kW on a three-phase 
line. Beyond these limits, an interconnection study is 
required, and the full cost of any study is passed 
through to the distributed generator. 
On December 1, 1999,14 the Texas Public Utility 
Commission adopted a rule that is more flexible and 
accommodating to utilities and distributed generators. 
The Texas proposal stated that a utility may conduct

a study before interconnecting any facility. However, 
Texas prohibits a utility from charging certain 
distributed generators for the cost of the study, 
including the following:          
•  Distributed power facilities that will not or do not 
export power to-the utility system, regardless of 
size  
•  Individual single-phase distributed power units 
exporting less than 50-kW to the utility system 
on a single transformer           
•  Individual three-phase units exporting not more 
than 150-kW to the utility system on a single 
transformer  
•  Pre-certified distributed power units (as defined 
in the rule) up to 500-kW that export not more 
than 15 percent of the minimum total load on a 
single radial feeder and also contribute not more 
than 25 percent of the maximum potential short 
circuit current on a single radial feeder. 
Developers or owners of distributed generating 
facilities not qualifying for one or more of these 
exemptions may be charged for the costs to conduct 
an interconnection study. 
The Texas rule also establishes certain performancerelated 
standards for a utility in cases where an 
interconnection study is required, as follows: 
Time Limit. The conduct of such pre-interconnection 
study shall take no more than four weeks. 
Written Findings Required. A utility shall prepare 
written reports of the study findings and make them 
available to the customer. 
Consideration of Costs and Benefits to System 
Required. The study shall consider both the costs 
incurred and the benefits realized as a result of the 
interconnection of distributed power to the 
companyís utility system. 
Estimate of Study Cost Required. The customer shall 
receive an estimate of the study cost before the utility 
initiates the study. 
12 
2.3 Business Practice Barriers 
Business practices for these purposes include the 
contractual and procedural requirements imposed by 
the utility before it allows interconnection. Although 
all such business practices are, in principle, subject to 
regulatory authority, there appears to be little 
regulatory attention so far to business practices that 
are discouraging distributed generators. 
Business practices create artificial barriers when they 
impose terms, costs, or delays that are unnecessary 
for purposes of safety and reliability, and are 
inconsistent with the underlying economics or other 
drivers of the distributed generation project. Many of 
the distributed generation developers that were 
interviewed believe that some utilities use 
unreasonable terms, excessive costs, and 
inappropriate delays to either gain utility advantage 
or impede the market for distributed power. The 
practices that most often create barriers center around 
the following:  
•  Initial utility contact and requests for 
interconnection  
•  Application and interconnection fees                            
•  Insurance and indemnification requirements                           
•  Utility operational requirements                 
•  Final interconnection requirements and 
procedures. 
The case studies reveal utility business practices that 
vary from utilities that promote distributed power 
under cooperative arrangements15 to those that 
actively oppose the entry of distributed power, 
including flat prohibition. As with the other 
categories of barriers, instances where the business 
practices of the utility resulted in projects where 
interconnection went smoothly provide a useful 
contrast to cases where substantial barriers were 
present. Such utilities value distributed power as a 
resource, particularly during peak demand periods, 
or see streamlined interconnection as a potential 
future market opportunity for them. 
15 For a description of a utility that has embraced and 
encouraged distributed generation see discussion of model 
peak shaving practices of Orange and Rockland on 
page 16.                                             
One wind energy customer called the local utility 
only twice, once at the initiation of the project to give 
notice of intent to connect and once at the conclusion 
in order to begin generation. The utility began net 
billing without further requirements.16 In California, 
the requirements for interconnecting small PV 
systems under the stateís net metering law have now 
become standardized to the point where most 
customers report no interconnection-related conflicts 
with their utilities.17 One common element associated 
with projects where distributed generation developers 
were more satisfied with their business dealings with 
the utilities was the designation by the utility of a 
specific contact person to review necessary 
requirements and assist in procedures. 
Interviews with project owners and developers 
suggest, however, that some utilities generally 
oppose interconnection of distributed power, with 
varying explanations. Some utility representatives 
told customers that interconnection was not possible. 
In some cases, utilities knowingly or unknowingly 
chose not to follow state commission regulations, 
forcing the customer to pursue legal remedies. In one 
case, a municipal utility initially refused to buy back 
power from a facility because the city claimed it was 
not regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission (FERC) and not subject to the Public 
Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA). The state 
utility commission eventually held that the city was 
subject to PURPA.18 In another case, the utility 
interpreted PURPA as requiring only Qualifying 
Facilities (QF) distributed generation to be connected 
to the distribution system. After long negotiations, 
the utility stated that it would make an exception to 
allow interconnection of non-QF generation in that 
specific case.19 
In other cases, utilities appeared to suffer more from 
a lack of experience and an absence of established 
procedures for addressing interconnection of 
distributed generators than intent to create barriers. 
In many of the case studies, the utilities did not have 
a designated department to deal with interconnection 
issues and could not provide the necessary guidance. 
As one project developer stated, ìthe utility didnít

understand the project benefits, though several people 
there did support the project. They did not understand 
how to build and connect this system, and they would 
not take the leadership role to coordinate project 
fulfillment." (Note that some developers believe that 
not all vendors have provided enough support to 
utilities and developers in this area.) This developer 
experienced significant delays completing the 
interconnection process.20 In some smaller 
installations, owners were able to install the project 
on the customer side of the meter without notifying 
the utility, so as to avoid the delays and costs 
associated with the interconnection process. 
Encouragingly, many utilities are demonstrating 
progress toward more expedient procedures for 
handling interconnection on a routine basis. Mostly 
this is in response to clear obligations to connect and 
more frequent requests for interconnection as has 
occurred in some states for smaller-scale systems 
under net metering laws. 
Initial Contact and Requests 
Case studies where interconnection was completed in 
a commercially reasonable time frame benefited from 
a consistent point of contact and a prompt response 
time. Judging from the case studies, such ìbest 
practiceî is not the usual procedure among many 
utilities. Reaching the appropriate utility 
representative and getting a consistent response was 
frequently cited as a significant problem for both 
small- and mid-sized projects. With large projects, 
developers usually included these costs as a ìpart of 
doing business with utilitiesî and could more easily 
bear the cost of lengthy contested legal negotiations. 
Many distributed power facilities could not. Most 
often cited problems included the following:                          
•  Application process delays                  
•  Unproductive time spent by individuals and 
developers  
•  Excessive procedural requirements. 
Application and Interconnection Fees 
Application and interconnection fees are generally 
required for the approval or permitting of distributed 
20 2-MW Diesel System in Colorado.                      
power facilities. These fees are typically assessed 
regardless of size of the proposed project. Therefore, 
they present a significant market barrier for smallerscale 
facilities. 
In one case, the utility initially requested an 
ìinstallation feeî of $776.80 for a 3-kW PV system 
or $259/kW. The customer contacted the state energy 
office for assistance, after which the utility's response 
changed. Approximately 15 days after payment of the 
fee, the utility returned the check stating that no 
"meter installation fee" was required. Contrary to the 
initial response, the customer's existing meter was bidirectional 
and therefore was capable of net metering 
the facility.21 
Some of the smallest distributed generators are asked 
to pay fees or charges equivalent to many monthsó 
or even yearsóworth of anticipated energy savings. 
For instance, in one case the owner of a 250-Watt 
ìAC Moduleî photovoltaic system faced up to $400 
in interconnection fees, which added $1,600/kW to 
the project costs and was equivalent to approximately 
ten years of energy savings from the system.22 
Insurance and Indemnification 
Requirements 
Insurance requirements are a particularly troubling 
issue for small distributed power facilities. Small 
distributed generators argue that the risks from 
facilities that use UL listed equipment and are 
installed in accordance with IEEE and other 
applicable standards are minimal, and comparable 
to electrical appliances and other equipment that are 
routinely interconnected without special 
requirements. Moreover, these distributed generators 
argue that in the unlikely event of an accident, 
existing laws are adequate to allocate liability among 
potentially responsible parties. Utilities argue that as 
"deep pockets," they are likely to be brought into any 
claim attributed to the operation of a customer-owned 
distributed generating facility. They add that 
generators pose increased risk compared to appliance 
and electric loads. On these grounds, they demand 
insurance and indemnification naming them as payee. 
21 Case #24. 
22 Case #26. 
14 
Insurance requirements are often high in relation to 
the project cost, particularly compared to standard 
commercial practice with other products. One utility 
required $1 million in workerís compensation 
insurance coverage and $5 million in commercial 
general liability insurance coverage for the parallel 
interconnection of any non-utility generating source. 
A 12-kW solar photovoltaic demonstration system in 
Florida (not a case study) was forced to shut down 
when the utility imposed a $1 million liability 
insurance requirement. The utility had claimed that 
the cost for required coverage would be in the range 
of $500 to $1,000. The facility owner received quotes 
for this coverage of $6,200 per year, however, and 
shut down the project because of this. 
In response to this issue of liability insurance 
requirements, at least five states have prohibited 
utilities from imposing liability insurance 
requirements on small-scale distributed power 
facilities. In at least four other states, utility 
regulatory commissions have reduced insurance 
requirements from the $500,000 to $2,000,000 range 
requested by utilities to $100,000 to $300,000, 
depending on the state and the type of facility.23 In 
New York, for example, the Public Service 
Commission rejected the utilitiesí proposed insurance 
requirements for small-scale PV systems, after 
concluding that the proposed requirements were 
ìclearly burdensome and overly costly,î and noting 
that one utilityís proposed requirements ìare 
23 The five states that have prohibited additional insurance 
requirements are California, Maryland, Nevada, Oregon, 
and Virginia. In Idaho, a utility-proposed $1 million 
insurance requirement was reduced by the PUC to 
$100,000. In New York, utility-proposed requirements of 
$500,000 to $1 million were reduced by the PSC to 
$100,000. In Vermont, utility-proposed requirements of 
$500,000 were reduced by the PSB to $100,000 for 
residential customersí systems and $300,000 for 
commercial customersí systems. Finally, in Washington, 
utility-proposed requirements of $2 million were reduced 
by the UTC to $200,000. See Response of the American 
Solar Energy Society, American Wind Energy 
Association, Interstate Renewable Energy Council, Solar 
Energy Industries Association, and Maryland-DC-Virginia 
Solar Energy Industries Association to the Request for 
Information from the Virginia Corporation Commission 
(August 30, 1999), on file with the Virginia Corporation 
Commission.                                         
practically impossible for residential customers to 
meet.î24 The New York Commission instead allowed 
utilities to require customers to demonstrate that they 
are carrying at least $100,000 in liability coverage 
through their existing homeownerís policies. 
Utility Operational Requirements 
Operational requirements imposed by utilities also 
can make distributed power applications 
uneconomical. In one case, a distributed generating 
facility operating in a network distribution system25 
was required by the utility to shut down if one of the 
network feeders went down. This operational 
requirement was contrary to the distributed 
generation facility's purpose of optimizing energy 
production and increasing reliability for the customer, 
and unexpected in light of the technical modifications 
and safety equipment the vendor agreed to install to 
operate as intended.26 
In another case, the utility required the facility to 
reduce its output to below the customer's loads served 
by the distributed power facility. Because the facility 
must limit its generation to ensure that it does not 
export energy to the utility, this also prevents any 
export of excess power to other customers. The 
distributed generation developer was told that the 
utility was concerned with preserving loads for the 
utilityís own baseload generating plants. This utilityimposed 
limitation eliminated any access to 
wholesale power markets for the distributed power 
facility. This operating constraint in turn cut off the 
economic and system benefits that might result from 
delivery into those markets during times of peak 
demand, or to meet specialized demand, as might 
arise for renewable energy, in those markets.27

Metering of Residential Photovoltaic Generation (Feb. 11,

25 In contrast to a radial-feed distribution system, a 
network distribution system accommodates multiple 
sources feeding a honeycomb grid with multiple paths and 
feeder lines into any one location. The multiple flow paths 
from any particular source to any particular load can be 
more complex on these systems, but the reliability impact 
of losing any one line can also be less severe.

over operation of equipment for the stated purpose of 
shutting down the facility for planned and unplanned 
outages28 of the utility system. In other cases, utilities 
imposed control requirements out of safety 
considerations or for maintaining distribution system 
stability. However, as discussed above, vendors claim 
that most of todayís distributed power equipment is 
designed to manage these legitimate safety needs. In 
most cases, discontinuing parallel operation during 
emergencies and other abnormal operating conditions 
can be easily handled through technical and 
contractual requirements without turning over 
complete operational control of the distributed power 
facility. Again, although utility operational control 
might have been acceptable for the much-larger 
PURPA facilities, it is often unacceptable for 
distributed power facilities, where customer 
objectives include the provision of backup or 
emergency power or sales into real-time power 
markets. 
In one instance where the utility needed the 
customer-owned, on-site, generation to reduce system 
peaks to meet the utilityís supply needs, the customer 
was nonetheless prohibited from peak shaving to 
reduce its own bill. The utility required exclusive 
control of the operation of the equipment, which 
allowed it to start the generator to meet utility 
requirements, while preventing the customer from 
doing so. In another case, the customer was allowed 
to curtail load during peak periods to reduce its bill, 
but not permitted to operate back up generation to 
continue operation during peak periods. The facility 
had a backup generator that it was willing to operate, 
but the utility would not allow operation.29 
Utilities also have procedural requirements 
appropriate for some, but not all, distributed power 
facilities. For example, one utility requires distributed 
facilities to maintain an operational log. Many 
utilities require a generator to notify the utility before 
bringing the facility on line. The utility may require 
the facility to delay synchronizing when the utility is 
experiencing line trouble or system disturbances. 
28 Planned outages occur for purposes such as maintaining 
lines; testing relays; rearranging, modifying, or 
constructing lines; and maintaining lines or station 
equipment. 
29 Case #8.                                           
Some of these requirements, originally developed 
(and intended) for larger facilities, are inappropriate 
for smaller facilities that are indistinguishable from 
normal load variations during the course of system 
operation. In fact, some utilities do exempt smaller 
facilities. 
Final Interconnection Delay 
Proponents of several projects reported delays 
continuing from the application process through final 
approval. In some cases these delays were 
procedural; in other cases, delays were equipmentrelated 
on the utility side. One utility postponed 
transmission connection on questions of system 
reliability for several months during the early high 
demand summer months, then reversed its position as 
the summer peak approached and the probability 
arose of capacity shortages.30 In another case, a utility 
entered a contract with a project owner allowing for 
interconnection if the project met certain criteria. 
After the project met the requirements and testing of 
the facility was complete, the utility stated that the 
facility could not interconnect at the time.31 
Project Delays 
As reported by project developers and customers, the 
total process from initially contacting the utility to 
obtaining final approval could be a lengthy one. In 17 
of the 65 cases, no delay was reported and the project 
was operational as scheduled. Twenty five of the 65 
projects experienced some delay. In three cases, the 
projects did eventually go forward even though the 
delay was considerably greater than two years. 
Figure 2-2 shows the actual reported delay in number 
of months beyond planned interconnection. Note that 
for 23 projects interviewers were not able to state 
definitely if a delay occurred or not; so only 42 cases 
are reported in this figure. 
Other Business Practice Barriers 
Utilities continue to maintain monopoly control of 
the distribution system to which distributed power 
projects must interconnect. Although their 
relationships with distributed generators are subject 
to regulatory scrutiny, as discussed above, utilities 
30 Case #3. 
31 500-kW Cogeneration System in New York. 
1) The 500-kW cogeneration project in New England is installed but it has not yet been interconnected. The project has been delayed for 24 months to date. In the fall of 1999, negotiations with the utility were still ongoing. 
(2) The 8-MW cogeneration project in New England was to replace old boilers in a factory that burned down. The customer sought to install the cogeneration system in the early 1990ís, but was not able to get the project installed until 
November 1999. Even though the project replaced a previously existing system with more-polluted boilers, the air board would not provide emissions credits. The air board wanted 99% improvement, not just 90%. After six years of 
negotiation, the air board finally approved the new system and provided the needed air credits. The new combustors use standard SOLONOX technology to reduce emissions to 15 ppm NOx and operating records show the system can 
achieve less than 10 ppm. 
(3) The 21-MW Cogeneration project in Texas was actually delayed for 10 years. The original start date was 1989 and the project was operational in September of 1999. The utility offered the customer lower rates each time the 
developer provided lower bids to the customer. Finally, the developer was able to offer a package that was competitive and the project went forward. 
(4) This project was actually delayed for 15 years. When the customer approached the utility in 1984 requesting to interconnect, the utility sent the customer a 68-page contract. Since that time, the customer has been attempting to 
interconnect and has started operating the wind turbine off the grid. The customer is still negotiating with the utility in an attempt to interconnect.

have traditionally been given a great deal of 
discretion in setting the interconnection framework 
for distributed power projects. As shown by the 
PURPA experience, they can use that discretion to 
discourage or prevent customers from 
interconnecting to ìtheirî grid. Distributed power 
projects have the same vulnerabilities as the much 
larger projects covered by PURPA, but with 
markedly smaller economic margins to overcome the 
barriers. One of the most troublesome examples from 
a public policy point of viewóselectively 
discounting tariffs to undercut prices offered by a 
distributed power projectóis discussed under 
regulatory barriers in Section 2.4 on page 27. 
Customer or Distribution-Level Peak Shaving 
Distributed generation can provide capacity to meet 
energy needs during peak periods, either for a 
customer or for a local utility. This ìpeak shavingî 
can reduce demand charges from the supplier, which 
rise with peak demand. Particularly when coupled 
with on-site benefits like emergency backup, or 
combined heat and power, this use of local generation 
offers significant economic advantages. Not 
surprisingly, there were several cases in which large 
utility customers, or local utilities purchasing from 
generation and transmission (G&T) wholesale 
suppliers, sought to employ distributed generation to 
reduce energy costs and secure other local benefits. 
The use of distributed capacity as an alternative to 
constrained transmission capacity, by a utility not 
involved in any of our case studies, stands in stark 
contrast to utility response in other cases. The Orange 
and Rockland Utilities, Inc., now a subsidiary of New 
York's Consolidated Edison, Inc., used a capacity 
payment tariff to recognize the value of distributed 
capacity in meeting system shortages. This 
specifically designed tariff established deaveraged 
capacity payments payable during summer months at 
specified locations to secure additional needed 
capacity during peak months. The utility reported the 
tariff worked effectively for more than ten years to 
supply needed capacity in the outlying portion of the 
service territory. Over the ten years, capacity 
payments ranged from $3/kW-month to $11/kWmonth 
for the four summer months. The higher 
capacity payments brought on capacity in a            
transmission-constrained area for many years. The 
ease of implementation and effectiveness of the 
Orange and Rockland capacity tariff reveals the 
potential of the untapped distributed power market 
and the widespread absence of any regulatory 
principles governing its emergence. For instance, the 
United Kingdom uses a demand credit to encourage 
generation in areas where transmission congestion is 
a recurring problem. 
Where existing tariff structures have encouraged or 
allowed customers to use distributed power 
investments to mitigate peak demand charges, some 
utilities sought to modify the tariffs to prevent 
customers from capturing these savings. Or, a shift to 
high peak demand charges on the standby service 
was used to shift the equivalent revenue recovery to 
the backup peak demand. In one case, the utility 
shifted peak demand charges from the full service 
tariff to the standby tariff to capture additional 
revenues from the distributed generator. This 
standby-penalty approach was largely responsible for 
those cases in which commercial customers 
disconnected from the utility system altogether by 
providing both regular and standby energy service 
from distributed power facilities. 
These cases with seemingly arbitrary and conflicting 
treatment of similar distributed power installations 
indicate the absence of coherent, consistent tariff 
principles governing the use of peak demand and 
backup demand charges. In many cases, these 
charges defined the market comparison between 
distributed power facilities and distribution utilities. 
Although multiple case studies provide examples of 
utilities using these charges to discourage distributed 
power, cases such as the Orange and Rockland utility 
using peak demand charges to encourage distributed 
power are rare. We found no record of utility 
regulators focusing on the relationship between such 
charges and their effects on the development of 
distributed power. Proceedings in California and New 
York, however, are looking at the underlying cost 
and tariff issues and may begin to address these 
potentially market-defining principles. 
18 
Several case study respondents also noted the marked 
difference between how a utility accustomed to a 
regulated monopoly approaches its projects and how 
a competitive business must approach its projects. 
For example, one utility objected to scheduling 
overtime or additional contracting expense to meet an 
interconnection deadline even when the developer 
offered to pay for the costs. Conversely, vendors in 
several instances claimed that the utility was using 
ëgold platingí practices, in which unnecessarily costly 
mandates were imposed. In one instance, the utility 
proposed a three million dollar substation instead of 
co-location and interconnection at the existing 
substation.32 In other cases the utility contractually 
limited the projectís ability to sell back to the grid.33 
These ìculturalî differences between traditional 
regulated utility practice and competitive practice 
were cited as barriers in several cases. 
In the case cited above, the substation 
interconnection requested by the developer would 
have offered direct distribution access to industrial 
and urban customers in a future restructured market, 
without additional transmission line reservation and 
fees. As ultimately configured by the utility, the 
interconnection enters at the transmission system and 
eliminates direct distribution access.34 
Negotiable Charges 
We define negotiable charges to include instances 
where the utility initially quoted fees, tariffs, 
equipment, or testing, but dropped these charges or 
demands after negotiation or pursuit of legal 
remedies. Because the cost of pursuing legal 
remedies is very high, the cost of challenging 
proposed charges impose a substantial cost for 
distributed generators, even if they prevail in having 
the fees and charges dismissed. More often, these 
charges simply stop projects or force the very small 
projects to proceed as ìpirates,î operating without 
notifying the utility. Case study respondents in all 
size categories reported having to confront such 
charges, and in several cases the cost of effectively 
challenging the charges simply led to abandonment 
of the project. 
32 Case #3. 
33 1.2-MW Cogeneration System in Illinois 
34 Case #3.                                           
The assessment of charges that later were abandoned 
was particularly prevalent with small customers (60kW 
or less). In fact, among the case studies, one-third 
of small customers were presented with charges that 
they ultimately did not pay. Charges initially sought 
by the utility were dropped or reduced in at least ten 
cases, as shown in Table 2-2. This high incidence of 
rescinded demands for smaller customers may result 
from such customers being more adamant about not 
paying extraordinary fees. Or, such assessments may 
have proven particularly effective in discouraging 
grid connection. In any case, the burden of the 
charges the utilities originally demanded relative to 
total project costs is much higher in residential and 
small commercial cases, which may account for these 
owners reporting these charges as extraordinary or 
unreasonable for the project size. Unfortunately for 
smaller sized generation facilities, however, there are 
genuine safety concerns even for small projects. 
2.4 Regulatory Barriers 
Seven projects documented in this study were 
abandoned or are still pending with little hope of 
completion due to regulatory barriers. The barriers 
included outright prohibition; what appeared to the 
distributed power developers as arbitrary tariff rates 
for access and backup power; and selective discount 
pricing designed to discourage customer use of 
distributed power. Case-by-case procedural review 
and legal remedies, where they exist, are not so much 
the solution as just a final barrier where the scale of 
the project can justify no effort beyond a simple and 
inexpensive way of asserting those rights. 
The case studies document the following types of 
regulatory barriers:       
•  Direct utility prohibition             
•  Tariff barriers    
−  Demand charges and backup tariffs                         
−  Buy-back rates          
−  Exit fees     
−  Uplift tariffs       
−  Regional transmission procedures and costs                                    
•  Selective discounting          
•  Environmental permitting.

10-kW Wind Turbine in Texas    Equipment requirements for metering, transformers, and relays were 
initially assessed but eventually dropped. The utility originally 
refused to buy back any power and eventually purchased power back 
at $1.5 cents/-kWh (avoided cost). 
10-kW Wind Turbine in 
Oklahoma                    
The customer was initially asked to pay for unnecessary metering and 
an isolation transformer. This requirement was eliminated after six 
months. In addition, the initial demand for a one-million-dollar 
liability insurance policy was relaxed. 
2.4-kW PV System in New 
Hampshire                   
The utility initially asked for a $250,000 comprehensive general 
liability policy and $1,000 for a site. The insurance demand was 
reduced to a certificate of insurance, and the site inspection fee was 
ultimately dropped. 
20-kW Hybrid Wind/PV System 
in Midwest                   
The utility initially requested the project owner to pay for the power 
pole, meter, and transformer for a new house he was building because 
of the renewable energy installation. The utility backed down after 
being reminded that they would not have asked a regular customer to 
pay for this basic initial hardware installation. 
17.5-kW Wind Turbine in 
Illinois                       
The utility initially requested expensive manual and automatic 
disconnects, synchronizing relays, voltage transformers, over/under 
voltage relays, and over/under frequency relays. Most of these 
demands disappeared after the wind turbine supplier spoke with the 
utility. 
7.5-kW PV and Propane System 
in California                  
The customer disputed interconnection fees of $776.80 but eventually 
paid in order to facilitate progress. The customer contacted the CEC 
for assistance and, as a result of the CECís efforts, the utility returned 
the payment of fees. 
40 Sites of 60-kW NG IC 
Systems in California           
The equipment supplier successfully challenged standby and demand 
charges imposed by two separate utilities, so no charges were 
ultimately applied. 
120-kW Propane Gas 
Reciprocating Engine For 
Hospital                     
The utility requested a $40,000 redundant circuit breakeróthat was 
no longer being manufactured because it was only used where 
extremely high-quality grade equipment with reliability ratings are 
required such as nuclear facilities. The utility also sought standby 
charges of $1,200/kW/year that were disapproved by the PUC. 
140-kW Natural-Gas Fired 
Reciprocating Engines in 
Colorado                     
The utility initially asked for an extra $23,000 worth of equipment for 
power factor correction and neutral circuit protection out rescinded 
the request after negotiation. 
132-kW PV System in California  The interconnecting utility requested a separate package of protective 
relays duplicating the electronic protection already integrated into the 
design. The cost was between $25,000 and $35,000 extra, although 
the utility eventually dropped the request. 
20 
Direct Utility Prohibition 
In several cases, as shown in Table 2-3, the utility 
simply prohibited distributed power systems from 
operating in parallel with the grid; that is, the 
utility simply refused to interconnect with these 
systems. In two cases the customers finally 
decided to operate independently of the grid. Two 
others eventually decided to abandon their 
projects. In one case, the utility claimed there was 
no legal requirement to force it to interconnect 
and declined to do so.35 In other instances, the 
wholesale generation and transmission utility 
supplying the distribution utility with power 
invoked ìall requirements contractsî to prevent 
the member distribution utility from allowing 
interconnection.36 Even projects installed on the 
customer side of the meter face prohibitions, some 
directly and others in the form of requirements to 
disconnect before operation or other utility 
limitations of on-site generation. 
There were several cases where utilities attempted 
to block distributed-power facilities, which were 
allowed under regulations in force at that time, by 
changing regulations to prohibit future 
installations. In one case that was particularly 
35 Case #15. 
36 Case #6.                                        
egregious, a truck-stop casino proposed a peakshaving 
and backup generation system as part of 
the casino expansion. The municipal utility 
granted initial approval. Site preparation 
commenced and equipment was delivered on site. 
Before installation was completed, the G&T 
wholesaler approached the city urging it to 
prohibit the installation. The city reversed its 
initial approval and immediately adopted a city 
ordinance to prohibit parallel operation. The 
ordinance also raised the municipal utilityís 
backup tariff, making the installation uneconomic 
for non-parallel operation. The installation was 
abandoned with losses borne by the owner and 
developer.37 
In another case, a city responded to a wind power 
project with a zoning ordinance regulating 
construction of wind turbines within the city 
limits, making it very difficult or impossible to get 
a permit to construct a wind turbine. Since the 
original site had obtained its construction permit 
before the ordinance, however, the project 
proceeded.38

Tariff Barriers 
Among the project owners and developers 
interviewed, tariffs were most often seen as 
discouraging distributed power, rather than 
encouraging it. These tariffs included the 
following: 
•  Demand charges and backup tariffs                         
•  Buy-back rates          
•  Exit fees      
•  Uplift tariffs (charges for distribution, 
ancillary services, capacity and losses)                           
•  Regional transmission procedures and costs. 
The distributed-generation projects typically 
offered benefits to the distribution grid in terms of 
peak shaving, reduced need for distribution 
system upgrades, and capital cost reductions. 
These benefits have been well documented in 
other reports. Nonetheless, the tariffs and rate 
designs encountered in this study did not account 
for either the provision of distribution services to 
the system or the particular benefits to the 
customer from distributed power.39 These rate 
design issues exist in both vertically integrated 
and restructured utilities. 
In some cases, rapidly adopted increases in fees 
and charges were used to stop development of 
distributed power projects. 
Demand Charges and Backup Tariffs 
Supplemental, backup, and standby tariffsó 
referred to collectively in this report as "backup 
tariffs" critically impact distributed power 
markets, because they can determine the 
economics of distributed power and grid supply 
in combination. Although every distributed 
power site could provide its own redundant 
backup power, the proposed facilities in this study 
generally sought access to both the grid and 
distributed power to optimize the combination. 
39 The narrow exceptions that prove the rule are 
instances like the regional de-averaged capacity 
purchase tariffs implemented by Orange & Rockland 
Utility in New York State to utilize customer-sited 
generation in place of new transmission lines for many 
years.                                            
As seen in Figure 2-3, backup charges can pose a 
significant barrier for both small and large 
distributed generators. High backup charges can 
very effectively discourage distributed power by 
overriding any system or customer benefits with 
substantial locked-in payments to the utility. 
Figure 2-3 also shows that standby charges levied 
by utilities on distributed generation projects can 
vary over a considerable range. The case studies 
demonstrate a lack of consistency and the absence 
of regulatory oversight of backup tariffs. 
In deregulated states, backup supply can be 
obtained from competitive suppliers in the market, 
where options are transparent. However, 
unrealistic demand charges included in the 
distribution and transmission tariff to access the 
competitively provided backup supply can be as 
equally detrimental as excessive backup tariffs 
and render a project economically unfeasible. 
In one case, high demand charges with 
continuing-demand billing ratchets were put in 
place on the grounds that the system must 
maintain capacity equal to the annual peak. For 
example, when the 200-kW fuel cell project is 
down, the owner is assessed a demand charge of 
$19.20/kW-month for that time and for the next 
12 months thereafter. If the unit is down during a 
peak demand period, the total cost for one outage 
could result in an annual demand charge of 
$46,080. In this case, there was also no 
recognition given for peak shaving and other 
system benefits of distributed power.40 
In another case, a 5-MW cogeneration project was 
cancelled because the utility assessed the standby 
charge at $1 million per year.41 The host facility (a 
hospital) provided a backup power system, but the 
utility refused to offer a partial credit for capacity 
provided by the backup system.42 In the state of 
New York, the annual standby charges range from 
$52.34/kW-year to $200/kW-yearóa variance 
factor of almost four. From the utility/regulatory 
40 Case #11. 
41 Case #5. 
42 The same backup power system would allow the 
hospital to run independently from the grid during local 
utility power outages.

perspective the type of generation employed to 
provide backup power can account for different 
tariffs, but nonetheless this variance has a large 
effect on the market. 
At their inception, some utilities appear to have 
utilized backup charges to discourage 
interconnection of self-generation by industrial 
firms and other commercial customers. The 
conference report of the Public Utility 
Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA)

suggests that some electric utilities purposely 
priced backup or standby service at a level that 
made it uneconomical for the customer to 
implement an on-site generation project. 
PURPA made this illegal and required utilities to 
implement reasonably priced backup charges. 
Nonetheless, regulatory policy and utility 
practice continue to use standby charges to 
discourage distributed power that would result in 
non-economic bypass. This is illustrated by a 
ìStandby Serviceî document that states as its 
purpose, "To discourage bypass of the 
Company's services and charges where such 
bypass44 is not economic from society's 
43 Conference Report on H.R. 4018, Public Utility 
Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, H. Rep. No. 1750, 
page 89, 95th Cong., 2d sess. (1978). 
44 There is a difference in regulatory treatment of 
what is termed ìeconomicî versus ìnon-economicî 
bypass. Economic bypass might occur where a new 
technology serves increased load in the territory at a 
cost less than the marginal cost to the utility of 
serving such a load. Non-economic bypass, however, 
is a concept that essentially admits that a particular 
customer has been asked by the regulatory regime to 
pay more than the utilityís marginal cost to serve it as 
a result of policy considerations, and that unless the 
tariff rate is reduced to something below the cost to 
self generate, but above the marginal cost of service, 
the customer can save money by self generating even 
though it is paying more than the utilityís marginal 
cost. The regulatory reasoning is thus that it is better 
to have the customer make some contribution to the 
fixed costs of the utility by paying something over 
marginal costs rather than leaving the system, which 
could incur the fixed costs increase for all. For 
example, one statement of the regulatory position 
states: ìNon-economic bypass and the inappropriate 
shifting of the fixed cost of the electrical system 
between or among customers are not fair and 
efficient competition, are contrary to the public            
standpoint and to prevent the shifting of the 
Company's Competitive Transition Cost (CTC) 
to other stakeholders that would occur in such 
circumstances."45 
The conditions under which backup tariffs are 
applied also vary. For example, some tariffs 
apply demand charges as well as backup service 
rates.46 In one case, the municipal utility created 
a new standby tariff specifically designed to stop 
a distributed power project. The city calculated a 
charge for 25,000-kWh of supplemental power 
at $5,400 under the newly adopted tariff, as 
compared to the total previous standard bill for 
80,000-kWh at $6,000. It appears that the utility 
established the tariff to dissuade the customer 
from proceeding with the distributed-power 
facility, since the new tariff is triggered by the 
existence of ìinstalled equipmentî independent 
of the customerís load profile. A customer with 
the same energy usage and load profile without 
such equipment on-site would presumably 
continue to receive bills under the more 
favorable standard tariff. In short, the purpose 
appeared to be solely to discourage on-site 
power installations. See the discussion of the 
260-kW natural gas generation system in 
Louisiana in the case studies. 
47 
Another case involved a utilityís attempt to 
obtain a backup tariff that would have assessed a 
120-kW facility a $1,200/kW-per-annum charge, 
or approximately $144,000 annually. Even if the 
facility operated constantly (as a baseload plant), 
it would only generate approximately $100,000 
worth of electricity annually. The PUC rejected 
the tariff, stating that if the facility was shut 
down the utility would not notice.48

continuing monopoly service should benefit, or at 
least not be harmed, by choices made by customers 
with competitive options.î Washington Public Utility

48 Case #14. 
24 
As part of the trend toward net metering for 
small renewable energy facilities, legislatures 
and utility regulatory commissions have severely 
limited or flatly prohibited the assessment of 
backup charges for distributed generators within 
certain categories of sizes or technologies. While 
such fees remain for the bulk of the distributed 
power projects not subject to net metering, the 
likelihood remains that as legislatures and 
regulatory commissions gain experience with the 
costs and benefits of distributed generation the 
instances of perceived abuses will be reduced. 
One California utility, for example, proposed 
backup charges in its tariff to implement 
Californiaís net metering law. It would have 
required customers to pay an additional fixed 
charge of $14 per month, plus additional 
variable charges of $2.15/kW of generating 
capacity per month. For a 1-kW photovoltaic 
system, these charges would have offset nearly 
90 percent of the energy savings the customer 
expected to capture from the system. After 
various stakeholders objected, the California 
Public Utilities Commission rejected the 
proposed charges, and the utility was required to 
revise its proposed tariff accordingly. 
Among the case studies, some larger customers 
were able to negotiate specialized electric 
contracts using the leverage of leaving the grid if 
necessary. One small project developer of 
several projects used the threat of leaving the 
grid to convince the utility to drop the backup 
charge.49 But there is no uniformity or assurance 
that smaller projects can successfully negotiate 
around these barriers and preliminary evidence 
that they often cannot. See Table 2-1. The lack 
of appropriate regulatory principles or standards 
for business practices thus creates uncertainty 
that effectively retards distributed power 
projects by increasing financial risks. As new 
technologies make on-site options available to 
commercial and residential customers already 
conditioned to retail choice, vendor and 
consumer demands will increase for uniform and 
predictable regulatory treatment that does not 
unduly burden distributed power 
interconnection.

Buy-Back Rates 
In addition to buying power from the grid, many 
on-site distributed power projects have excess 
capacity (the ability to produce power above that 
required by the host facility), which can benefit 
the grid if made available in times of capacity 
shortage. This can also benefit the customer if 
the customer is able to sell the excess capacity.50 
In vertically integrated monopoly systems, the 
only market for this power is the utility. The 
utility buy-back rates thus define the only 
market for this power in these states. 
51 
In the cases where distributed power economics 
rely on the utility purchase of some portion of 
the power, several proposed facilities were 
abandoned because the buy-back rate offered 
was too low. Utilities with excess generation 
capacity or a strategic interest in maintaining 
their customer base have little business incentive 
to facilitate the interconnection of new suppliers. 
The typical buy-back rate of 1.5 to 2¢/kWh may 
reflect the utilities off-peak wholesale rates, but 
will not provide the benefits of the higher onpeak 
wholesale costs of the utility. In a typical 
case, offering buy-back rates in this range, the 
utility also required the customer to install a 
separate meter at the ownerís expense. For this 
proposed wind project, the low buy-back rate 
resulted in installation of a smaller wind turbine 
that produced little or no excess energy. Because 
wind is an intermittent resource, this meant that 
the project provided much smaller portion of the 
ownerís electricity needs than originally 
planned. 
52 
On the other hand, successful distributed power 
buy-back tariffs such as the Orange and 
Rockland distributed power capacity payments, 
demonstrate an approach that recognizes the 
value of distributed capacity in meeting system 
50 This benefit was one of the primary drivers of the 
recent Texas action adopting its distributed 
generation rules, see Section 2.2 on page 11. 
51 In competitive supply markets the path to the 
competitive power market is the local distribution 
system access tariff, or ìuplift tariffî of the 
distribution utility.

capacity shortages in a manner that benefits all 
parties. (See discussion at page 17.) 
Exit Fees 
As more states adopt stranded cost charges as 
part of restructuring, exit fees have emerged as a 
major barrier to new distributed-power 
technologies, in some cases a long-term barrier. 
The potential amount of the chargesóup to 
2¢/kWh or moreóis having a significant impact 
on incentives for customer load management in 
general. 
As with other barriers, the variations in exit fees 
and related charges and in utility collection 
practices from state to state make the 
development of national markets for distributed 
power more difficult. For example, New Jersey 
exempted customer on-site generation and load 
management from exit fees unless and until a 
utilityís combined loads drop to 92.5 percent of 
current levels. Neighboring Pennsylvania, which 
is within the same ISO region, retains exit fees 
through 2010 for some utilities at rates in excess 
of 2¢ /kWh. Some California utilities have 
threatened collection of exit fees for customers 
considering on-site combined heat-and-power 
options. Especially in areas of load growth and 
supply shortages, the rationale for tying exit fees 
to historical use with its intentional dampening 
effect on customer-side supply-and-demand 
options needs to be reviewed by regulators and 
other policymakers. The recent Texas rules 
confirm the system benefits provided by 
distributed generation in such instances. The 
New Jersey approach of allowing distributed 
power to grow in step with current market 
demand also formally recognizes the benefits of 
providing distributed power access to the 
market. Similarly, Connecticut is assessing the 
applicability of exit fees to combined heat and 
power and other Qualifying Facilities under 
FERC regulations, as well as considering 
whether there would be enough cogeneration 
activity for exit fees to be a significant issue.         
Uplift Tariffs 
In competitive electricity markets, the 
distribution utility does not define the market for 
power from distributed facilities. Instead, the 
newly opened competitive market for wholesale 
and retail supply defines the market. The 
utilityís buy-back rate is therefore not the critical 
issue in competitive markets that it is when the 
utility constitutes the sole potential buyer. 
Rather, the competitive issue shifts to the rate to 
be charged by the distribution utility for 
transmission of the power to the market. Many 
of the metering and technical interconnection 
issues are technically the same, but competitive 
markets have given rise to additional charges for 
ìdistribution wheeling,î which includes 
distribution capacity and ancillary services, up to 
the transmission level (uplift tariffs) as well as 
additional tariffs, procedures, accounting and 
scheduling at the regional transmission level. 
In the projects studied for this report, utilities 
proposed a variety of uplift tariffs, charges, and 
penalties. In several cases the per-kWh charges 
were dropped after lengthy negotiations. The 
cases in this study encountering uplift tariffs 
were renewable energy facilities intending to 
supply ìgreen market" power to the regional 
grid system. In one case, the tariff proposed was 
based on peak production at $5 per kW-month 
for the uplift, which amounted to about 0.7 
¢/kWh for high capacity factor generation units 
(about 1.5¢ per kWh for lower capacity factors 
as occurs with wind generation). This tariff 
resulted from application of the distribution 
companyís open access (or wholesale) tariff 
applicable to large generationóapplied in fulló 
despite the fact that the power was to be 
generated and used locally, without ever 
reaching the utilityís transmission facilities.53 
The absence of any commonly accepted 
ratemaking principles for these distribution 
charges is a significant issue, particularly given 
the potential system and market benefits of 
53 Case #7. 
26 
distributed power. Using common rate-making 
principles, as distributed power typically reduces 
loads on the distribution (and transmission) 
systems, distributed power should under some 
circumstances be entitled to a credit rather than a 
charge. 
Regional Transmission Procedures and 
Costs 
In todayís competitive wholesale electricity 
markets, delivery of power into the regional 
transmission market, is governed by rules that 
have been designed by and for large-scale 
generation. Like the rates and rules developed 
for the central station model at the distribution 
level, these rules are often inappropriate or 
prohibitively expensive for smaller-scale 
distributed power. With the creation of 
independent system operators (ISOs) to manage 
regional transmission markets, the access issues 
have become even more complicated for smaller 
distributed generation projects. Regional 
transmission organizations (RTOs) and ISOs 
frequently fail to recognize or account for 
capacity less than one megawatt, which may 
thus require aggregation of systems to 
participate at the RTO/ISO level, another barrier 
to competitive markets. 
In one case study, the project developer 
determined that under existing rules in 
California, distribution-level generators have no 
way to wheel power to the ISO responsible for 
coordination and dispatch of power under retail 
competition in California. This apparent absence 
of any market path was reflected in the original 
utility proposal, which specified that the utility 
would not wheel power on behalf of the project. 
The project developer understood that the 
California ISO might itself be looking at 
solutions to this problem, but at the time of this 
review the issue remained unresolved.54 
In the New England ISO region, application of 
the full regional transmission tariffs, including 
ancillary service and loss rules were the pivotal 
barrier to a proposed 1-MW landfill gas project, 
which was abandoned as a result. The regional 
54 Case #13.                                        
transmission charges were to be assessed even 
though the proposed project would serve only 
local loads within a single distribution area. 
Alternative ìpoint-to-pointî transmission tariffs, 
which required interval metering and 
telemetering of data to the system operator were 
more expensive than local distribution system 
service.55 
Another case involved a similar experience with 
an ISO. The ISO sent a letter that turned the 
matter over to the local distribution company. A 
wind developer planning a 130-kW market pilot 
facility completed lengthy negotiations with 
technical and legal personnel of the distribution 
utility over proposed interconnection 
engineering fees. These fees were in excess of 
the projected first year gross revenue from the 
project. The proposed fees included payment of 
the utility's legal fees to prepare an agreement 
covering all items included by other utilities in a 
tariff. As initially presented, the agreement 
included a specific distribution line loss number 
to six decimal places (just over 2.5 percent), in 
addition to any ISO loss assignments. As the 
facility was prohibited from generating more 
than one-third of the minimum load on the 
distribution system, its actual impact was to 
reduce supply losses for the utility. The 
distribution loss charge was eventually dropped. 
After several months of negotiation with the 
distribution utility, the ISO informed the 
developer that a separate interconnection service 
agreement with the ISO would also be 
required.56 
A standard regional transmission and ISO 
approach is to assign losses of five to nine 
percent to all retail loads on the assumption that 
they are being served from the pooled 
transmission facilities. That approach requires 
five to nine percent more generation delivered 
than load served. One of the core competitive 
advantages of distributed generation is its 
intentional placement in close proximity to the 
loads served, precisely in order to reduce 
transmission and distribution costs such as line 
losses. The application of the same rule-of55 
Case #7. 
56 130-kW Wind Turbines in Pennsylvania. 
27 
thumb line loss charges applied to bulk power is 
both illogical and anti-competitive vis-‡-vis 
distributed power. In one of our cases, a landfill 
facility intended to serve local loads would not, 
in fact, have used a transmission path (contract 
or actual), but nonetheless was charged for 
transmission losses. Even where the distributed 
power is sold into the transmission grid, in most 
cases, by virtue of its location on the distribution 
system, distributed generation has the actual 
physical effect of reducing system losses. 
Distribution utility responses to requests to 
market ìwholesaleî distributed power are widely 
inconsistent. Certain aspects of the typical 
proposal to a distributed generation 
interconnection are troublesome from the 
viewpoint of distributed utility developers. First, 
there are no provisions for credit or value for 
reduced losses on the distribution and 
transmission system and reduced power import 
as a result of distributed power. Second, some 
utilities have attempted to add additional loss 
adjustments and distribution charges on top of 
assigned transmission losses. 
There was one proposal for ISO accounting 
treatment of small (under 1-MW) distributed 
power sources as ìnegative loads,î which 
resulted in a credit at the wholesale transmission 
level for metered generation plus nine percent. 
While this latter approach is more consistent 
with system benefits produced by distributed 
power, this treatment is the exception rather than 
the rule, and is the inadvertent result of ISO 
accounting rules. This ISO, however, is reported 
to be reconsidering this treatment.57 
Selective Discounting 
Like the concept of uneconomic bypass, 
undisclosed selective discounts run counter to 
efforts to increase transparent competitive 
markets and innovation as supplements to 
regulation. From this perspective, statesanctioned 
price discounting under public utility 
commission-enforced secrecy can be an absolute 
barrier to the creation of viable markets for onsite 
distributed power. Case study respondents 
57 Case #7.                                         
reported economic development tariff 
discounting as one of the utilitiesí most 
commonly used tools to keep large electric 
customers from pursuing more economic 
distributed power alternatives. Combined heatand-power 
(CHP) projects, gas turbines, and 
other larger distributed technologies were 
offered multiple rounds of discounted pricing, to 
the point where several vendors report utility 
discounts as the most common customer benefit 
arising in the market for these innovative 
technologies. 
58 
In one case, a CHP project was abandoned when 
the utility offered the customer a seven-year 
guaranteed price incentive. The utility made 25 
progressively better proposals to the customer 
before the final offer was made, even though the 
CHP project would have actually produced 
power more efficiently, with lower actual 
production costs and environmental emissions, 
58 One of the fundamental principles of monopoly 
tariffs is ìthe obligation to furnish service and to 
charge rates that will avoid undue or unjust 
discrimination among customers,î which results in 
similar customers within a rate class paying the same 
rates [See: Principles of Public Utility Rates, James 
C. Bonbright, Albert L. Danielsen, David R 
Kamerschen, PUR, Inc. Second Edition, 1988, at p. 
28 
than the traditional generation provided by the 
utility.59 
During the bidding process the customer used 
this leverage to pit the utility and the distributed 
power supplier against one another to negotiate a 
discounted deal for its power. In the final hours 
of contract negotiation between the equipment 
supplier and the customer, the utility presented 
the combined offer it had brokered with the 
regulatory authority to persuade the customer to 
abandon the cogeneration project.60 
In a case not included in this study, the project 
developer reported that the utility successfully 
negotiated a deal with the big three automakers 
to reduce their rates by three percent to five 
percent in exchange for a long term agreement 
to not install local generation systems. 
Obviously, discounted utility power is 
advantageous for customers who can get it, at 
least for the term of the discount. But access to 
these discounted rates is unpredictable. Even 
where customer discounts are made available, 
they are often limited in duration. In one case 
where a customer was considering cogeneration, 
the utility offered the customer a better rate, but 
delayed its implementation for almost two years. 
Some discounted rates only last for a short 
period such as a year or two then revert to 
previous higher levels.61 Finally, the 
requirements for obtaining the discount 
sometimes require expenditure of funds to show 
serious intent to leave the system. An 
expenditure of several thousand dollars for 
engineering demonstrating a combined heat and 
power facility supported a reduction by 11.77 
percent discount, approved by one stateís PUC.62 
59 Case #4.

project by assessing transport rates for natural gas to

distribution pipes at a cost that was nine times higher 
than the rate the utility charged itself). Case #4.

Environmental Permitting 
Requirements As Market Barriers 
Environmental permitting requirements can be a 
significant barrier in many regions of the 
country, especially for smaller projects. For 
many projects covered in this report, 
environmental testing and emissions 
requirements were as stringent for small projects 
as for larger projects. As with custom 
engineering requirements and other similar 
costs, smaller projects cannot bear the same cost 
of emissions testing as larger projects and 
remain feasible. In one case, for a 60-kW 
installation of natural-gas fired power supply, 
projected initial costs were $2,500 for testing 
and $200/month for inspections.63 
Unfortunately, distributed generators as well as 
larger merchant plants are treated as new sources 
even when they displace older, inefficient, and 
polluting sources.64 Worse, in the projects 
reviewed in this report, cogeneration facilities 
were assessed for environmental permit 
purposes based on combustion efficiency and 
not overall energy output efficiency and thus are 
not given credit for the added thermal energy 
used. 
While beyond the scope of this study, 
environmental permitting issues will need to be 
addressed by the appropriate agencies, as most 
current siting processes were designed for large 
power plants, thus posing barriers to distributed 
power analogous to those more fully discussed 
in this report.

several other cases. 8-MW Cogeneration System in

2.5 Barrier-Related Costs of 
Inte rconnection 
To attempt to quantify the various categories of 
barriers to market entry for distributed 
generators, the customer or developer was asked 
in each case to estimate the ìbarrier-related" 
costs arising in each case study. Costs defined as 
ìbarrier-related costs of interconnectionî 
included the customerís or developerís estimate 
of the costs of the various barriers discussed in 
this report. 
These cost estimates do not include extra time 
spent by project developers or customers, nor do 
these cost estimates include lost savings because 
of utility delays, annual fees, or other tariffs 
(except exit fees). Backup charges were only 
included as a one-time charge if they stopped the 
project. These estimates are thus strictly ìout of 
pocket costsî that exceeded the project 
developerís necessarily subjective determination 
of appropriate, anticipated, interconnection 
costs. 
Table 2-4 provides a summary of the barrierrelated 
costs by project for the 25 cases for 
which costs above normal were reported. 
Figure 2-4 provides the costs in $/kW. 
Figure 2-5 shows the interconnection costs 
above normal for renewable projects, whereas 
Figure 2-6 quantifies the costs for fossil fuel 
projects. These lists do not include 16 projects 
where no barrier-related costs were reported.65 
In addition, six projects are not included in these 
data because they did not interconnect. Cost 
estimates were not known for another 18 of the 
projects. 
As can be seen in Figure 2-4, barrier related 
interconnection costs in one state ranged from 
$5.81/kW to $1,333/kW. Smaller projects were 
affected more than larger projects. 
65 Some of these 16 projects reported ìexcessiveî 
annual backup charges which were not included 
because the project interconnected and the backup 
charge was an annual charge.                           
For illustrative purposes, the expected costs to 
interconnect a 43-kW commercial PV system in 
Pennsylvania were included even though this 
facility did not attempt to interconnect. 
Interconnection was prohibited because the 
project developer estimated that it would cost 
between $30,000 to $40,000 ($698/kW$930/kW) 
in consulting and engineering fees. 
2.6 Findings 
By interviewing proponents of distributed 
generation projects about problems encountered 
in seeking utility grid interconnection, this study 
identifies a variety of barriers to the 
interconnection of distributed generation 
projects. The anecdotal nature of this study 
presents the barriers from the perspective of the 
proponents and does not assess their prevalence. 
The study does, however, show that the barriers 
are very real, that they can block what otherwise 
appear to be valuable projects, and that they are 
independent of technology or location. 
More than half of the case studies identified 
barriers in each of the categories: technical, 
business practice, and regulatory. Technical 
barriers principally center around equipment or 
testing required by utilities for safety, reliability, 
and power quality. Project proponents often felt 
that these requirements were unnecessarily 
costly because their generating equipment and 
related facilities already included adequate 
safety, reliability, and power quality features. 
Many developers indicated that the utilities' 
interconnection-related business practices were 
among the most significant barriers they 
encountered. A common problem is the 
difficulty and length of the interconnection 
approval process, often resulting from a simple 
lack of a designated utility contact person or 
established procedure. Other business practices 
seen as unnecessary barriers by project 
proponentsóparticularly for smaller projectsó 
included application and interconnection fees 
and insurance requirements.

The regulatory scheme under which distribution 
utilities operate presents formidable barriers for 
distributed power technologies. These barriers go 
beyond the problems of technical interconnection 
requirements or utility delay, which are more 
readily apparent to the market. They grow out of 
long-standing regulatory policies and incentives 
designed to support monopoly supply and average 
system costs for all ratepayers. Today, the 
customer's desire for onsite generation is the driver 
for distributed power markets. The regulatory 
regime for distribution utilities is least prepared for 
this customer-driven market, and significant 
barriers arise as a result. In the present regulatory 
environment, utilities have little or no incentive to 
encourage distributed power even in cases when it 
provides benefits to the distribution system. To the 
contrary, regulatory incentives understandably drive 
the utility to defend itself against market entry of 
distributed generation. Revenues based on 
throughput and system averaged pricing are 
optimized by keeping maximum loads and highest 
revenue customers on the system. 
Among the barriers identified in the case studies as 
sources of contention capable of blocking projects 
were excessive charges for supplemental utility 
power, for utility capacity needed in case the 
customer needs replacement utility power (backup 
charges), for transmitting the customer-generated 
power to other customers (wheeling charges), and 
for leaving the utility system (exit fees because of 
stranded costs), as well as rates paid by the utility 
for the customer-generated power which did not 
fully credit its benefit to the grid. Additional 
distribution and transmission charges for selling 
power from the customer site to either the utility or 
the wholesale market are raising new tariff issues 
with widely divergent results from one utility 
territory to another, leading to Federal Regulatory 
Commission interest in the area. While some 
utilities, regulatory commissions, and independent 
system operators have implemented tariff structures 
specifically dealing with distributed generation, 
there is not yet an accepted set of regulatory 
principles to be applied in an efficient national 
framework to accommodate distributed generation.       
The Barriers 
Several common patterns emerge from review of 
the 65 case studies in this report (with 26 
representative examples presented in detail in the 
next section).   
•  There are a variety of technical, business 
practice, and regulatory barriers to 
interconnection in the US domestic market.                              
•  These barriers discourage and sometimes 
prevent distributed generation projects from 
being developed.       
•  The barriers exist for all distributed-generation 
technologies and in all parts of the country.                              
•  The impacts of lengthy approval processes, 
project-specific equipment requirements, and 
high standard fees are particularly severe for 
smaller distributed generation projects.                          
•  Many barriers being encountered in today's 
marketplace appear to derive from or are more 
significant because of the fact that utilities have 
not previously dealt with many small-project or 
customer-generator interconnection requests.                               
•  Many barriers also derive from or are more 
significant because there is not yet a national 
consensus on technical standards for connecting 
equipment, necessary insurance, reasonable 
charges for activities related to connection, or 
agreement on appropriate charges or payments 
for distributed generation.              
•  Utilities often have the flexibility to remove or 
lessen barriers.       
•  Distributed generation project proponents faced 
with technical requirements, fees, or other 
barriers that they found too burdensome are 
often able to get those barriers removed or 
lessened by informally protesting to the utility, 
to the utility's regulatory agency, or to other 
public agencies. But, this usually requires 
considerable additional time, effort, and 
resources.  
•  Official judicial or regulatory appeals, however, 
were often seen as too costly for relatively 
small-scale distributed generation projects. 
35                                           
•  Distributed generation project proponents 
frequently felt that existing rules did not give 
them appropriate credit for the contributions 
they make to meeting power demand, reducing 
transmission losses, or improving 
environmental quality. 
Suggested Actions To Remove or 
Mitigate Barriers 
The purpose of this study was to review examples 
of the barriers that non-utility generators of 
electricity encounter when attempting to 
interconnect to the electrical grid. In the course of 
the study, developers and utilities sometimes 
suggested solutions to these barriers. From these 
suggestions, the authors compiled a list of actions 
that could begin to eliminate unnecessary market 
barriers. 
One of the key action items was the need to 
encourage collaborative action. Although regulatory 
proceedings and legal challenges eventually would 
resolve most of the barriers identified, collaborative 
efforts among all stakeholders are likely to resolve 
barriers more quickly and efficiently than 
potentially adversarial proceedings. 
The other action items were divided into three 
categories: reducing technical barriers, reducing 
business practice barriers, and reducing regulatory 
barriers. 
Reduce Technical Barriers 
Adopt uniform technical standards for 
interconnecting distributed power to the grid ó 
Standardized interconnection requirements, 
sometimes called "plug and play" standards, are key 
to opening markets for manufactured distributed 
power equipment. This equipment could have the 
necessary safety and power quality protection built 
in at the factory if national standards were in place. 
Industry and the U.S. Department of Energy have 
been working through the auspices of the IEEE to 
develop standards for the interconnection of 
distributed generation resources to electrical power 
systems, to meet safety, power quality, and 
reliability requirements. Uniform adoption of the 
resulting standards is necessary to eliminate the          
barrier posed by project-specific interconnection 
requirements. 
Adopt testing and certification procedures for 
interconnection equipment ó For the IEEE 
interconnection standards to be effectively 
implemented, testing and certification procedures 
must be in place to assure that generating 
equipment and the associated interconnection 
devices which provide the interface with the electric 
power grid meet the standards. Equipment that is 
"pre-certified" can be confidently approved by 
utilities as meeting their safety and power quality 
concerns without any further review. Equipment 
manufacturers will depend on being able to precertify 
equipment because the economics of 
distributed power requires mass production of 
equipment that can be installed and operated with 
minimal site-specific engineering. Stakeholders 
interested in promoting distributed power should 
expedite the task of pre-certification through 
appropriate testing and certification organizations 
and should fully support the adoption and use of 
pre-certified equipment. 
Accelerate development of distributed power 
control technology and systems ó If the use of 
distributed power is to grow beyond isolated 
installations, grid operators need access to control 
and system integration technologies that allow 
optimal use and delivery of the power. These 
technology needs cover a broad range of systems 
operation research and development issues 
addressing open architecture, real time monitoring, 
control, command, communications, quality, 
reliability, and safety. 
Reduce Business Practice Barriers 
Adopt standard commercial practices for any 
required utility review of interconnection ó 
Delays and expense arising from the lack of 
standard utility procedures for dealing with 
distributed power was one of the most frequently 
cited complaints of distributed power project 
proponents. Specific complaints included the 
absence of any utility contact person to handle 
interconnection requests, or unpredictable and 
open-ended initial price quotes from the utility for 
processing interconnection requests. Recent 
regulatory attention in some states, notably Texas 
36 
and New York, promises to help by setting uniform 
statewide procedures. Utilities, vendors, developers, 
regulators, and their associations can adopt standard 
business practices for handling interconnection 
requests. 
Establish standard business terms for 
interconnection agreements ó The terms and 
conditions of utility interconnection agreements 
(often modeled on agreements applicable to much 
larger facilities) were cited as barriers by many 
surveyed distributed power project proponents. 
Fees, studies, insurance and indemnification 
requirements, and operating limitations appropriate 
for large utility generators may not be necessary for 
smaller facilities and act as significant impediments 
to distributed power installations. These 
requirements also vary tremendously from utility to 
utility, which deters commercial scale marketing. 
Some states have adopted simple "one page" 
agreements and reasonable insurance limits for 
residential- and small commercial-scale systems. 
Other states have begun to address standard terms 
and fees for industrial-scale distributed power. 
Using a collaborative process of the type used in 
connection with the Texas regulations, distributed 
power stakeholders can develop standard business 
terms and provisions for uniform adoption by 
utilities and regulators. 
Develop tools for utilities to assess the value and 
impact of distributed power at any point on the 
grid ó Distributed power can offer significant 
system benefits for utilities and grid customers as a 
whole. These benefits include reducing 
transmission and distribution losses, leveling out 
demand profiles, saving higher cost distribution 
investment, and avoiding new central generation or 
transmission lines, among others. Transmission 
system planners are accustomed to monitoring 
networks and their operating instabilities and to 
analyzing investment tradeoffs. Prior to the recent 
growth in distributed generation, however, there has 
been little need for that kind of analysis for 
distribution systems. Accordingly, case study 
respondents reported that having the means to 
quickly assess the impacts and benefits, technical 
and economic, of a proposed distributed power 
project at a particular location would assist in more 
accurate utility response and price signals to 
optimize deployment of these new distribution           
system resources. Utilities, regulators, and 
distributed generation proponents need to 
collaboratively develop these tools in time to 
support the new markets for distributed power. 
Reduce Regulatory Barriers 
Develop new regulatory principles compatible with 
distributed power choices in both competitive and 
utility markets ó "Anti-bypass" provisions under 
traditional regulatory principles allow utilities to 
discourage distributed power, particularly larger 
customer-sited projects, by offering customers 
discounts to stay with the utility. Other traditional 
regulatory requirements create financial incentives 
for utilities to discourage loss of load or to add 
charges to distributed power facilities for use of the 
distribution system. New principles are needed to 
balance the interests of various customer classes, 
and to address market efficiencies and 
environmental benefits. A national policy dialogue 
among traditional utility stakeholders and the newer 
market entrants should develop consensus on new 
principles governing the new markets. 
Adopt regulatory tariffs and utility incentives to fit 
the new distributed power model ó For many of 
the case studies, the primary barrier was a utility 
tariff rate specifically applied to onsite generation. 
For example, utilities sometimes assessed backup 
tariffs near or even exceeding the prices previously 
charged for full electrical service. Also, back-haul 
or uplift tariffs arise under state and federal 
jurisdiction. These tariffs can create what were in 
several cases insurmountable barriers to delivering 
locally generated power to wholesale markets. In 
some states, customers are charged exit fees for 
disconnecting from the gridóforgoing the 
interconnection benefits of backup power and 
access to wholesale markets. Tariffs balancing 
customer, utility and market interests need to be 
developed consistent with appropriate applicable 
regulatory principles. Likewise, new mechanisms 
under which the utilities can earn financial rewards, 
rather than incur financial penalties, for optimizing 
the use of distributed power must be part of the new 
regulatory approach to these markets. 
37 
Establish expedited dispute resolution processes 
for distributed generation project proposals ó 
Relief delayed in many cases was relief denied for 
new distributed power entrants attempting to enter 
the market. The case studies in this report showed a 
strong pattern of reduced interconnection barriers 
when distributed power project proponents 
contested them. Official regulatory agency 
challenges, however, were typically seen as too 
difficult and costly, especially for smaller projects, 
and many proponents did not or could not 
economically pursue such challenges. Regulatory 
bodies and distributed generation stakeholders 
should develop expedited dispute resolution 
processes for distributed generation projects. 
Define the conditions necessary for a right to 
interconnect ó The combination of acceptable 
technical standards, business practices, and 
regulatory principles implies a right to interconnect 
to the public network under those defined 
conditions. But unlike the public 
telecommunications network, where the right to 
interconnect customer-owned equipment is 
established under similar standards imposed by both 
the states and the Federal Communications 
Commission, there is not now any established 
underlying right to connect to the electric grid. 
There were several case-study examples of 
distributed power proponents being denied 
interconnection and parallel operation by either 
investor owned or publicly owned utilities. For the 
potential benefits of competitive markets and 
distributed power to the nation's energy system to 
be realized, the conditions under which distributed 
power facilities have the right to interconnect 
should be explicitly addressed rather than left to 
case-by-case determination. For example, new 
customer-sited protective equipment can prevent 
exports of power to the grid and safely disconnect 
from the grid when necessary, allowing customers 
the freedom to generate for their own load while 
assuring safety for other grid customers. These "no 
export" customer-sited options, subject to 
certification under approved standards, are one 
category that should universally be allowed to 
interconnect. Defining the conditions that support a 
universal right to interconnect is key to unlocking 
the national market and customer investment in 
these promising distributed power technologies.            
A Ten-Point Action Plan For Reducing 
Barriers to Distributed Generation 
Reduce Technical Barriers 
(1)  Adopt uniform technical standards for 
interconnecting distributed power to the grid. 
(2)  Adopt testing and certification 
procedures for interconnection equipment. 
(3)  Accelerate development of distributed 
power control technology and systems. 
Reduce Business Practice Barriers 
(4)  Adopt standard commercial practices for 
any required utility review of interconnection. 
(5)  Establish standard business terms for 
interconnection agreements. 
(6)  Develop tools for utilities to assess the 
value and impact of distributed power at any 
point on the grid. 
Reduce Regulatory Barriers 
(7)  Develop new regulatory principles 
compatible with distributed power choices in 
both competitive and utility markets. 
(8)  Adopt regulatory tariffs and utility 
incentives to fit the new distributed power 
model. 
(9)  Establish expedited dispute resolution 
processes for distributed generation project 
proposals. 
(10) Define the conditions necessary for a 
right to interconnect.

Conclusion 
As indicated by the case studies in this report, a 
wide range of barriers affect grid interconnection of 
distributed generation projects. Many of these 
barriers can block what appear to be viable projects 
with potential benefits to both the customer and the 
utility system. On the other hand, the trend towards 
development and adoption of uniform technical 
standards for interconnection, the success of 
individual state regulatory proceedings on 
distributed generation, and the exemplary programs 
of individual utilities to promote distributed 
generation indicate the potential for resolution of 
most of these barriers. 
A distribution system optimized for new distributed 
power technologies and customer choice will 
ultimately emerge. Regulatory and business models 
are needed to encourage evolution toward and 
handle the transition to that future distribution 
system. Significant steps toward this goal have been 
taken particularly with the rules promulgated by the 
New York and Texas utility commissions, but much 
work remains to be done. This report is intended to 
identify the various barriers in the hope of 
encouraging stakeholders to tackle the challenge of 
resolving the underlying issues. Distributed 
generation promises greater customer choice, 
efficiency, and environmental benefits. Resolving 
barriers to interconnection is a critical step toward 
achieving the full potential benefits of distributed 
generation and realizing the market opportunities 
that distributed generation technologies provide.

SECTION 3 CASE STUDIES 
In this section we provide narrative descriptions of 26 
case studies included in this project. We chose the 26 
case studies as a representative cross section of the 65 
cases studied. These case studies were also the ones 
for which the most detailed and reliable information 
was available. Our intent was to represent large and 
small projects alike. Initially, we equally represented 
each size category; however, the 25-kW to 1-MW 
size range had several cases that were worthy of 
detailed representation. Specific case studies could 
be segregated either by technology (i.e., wind, solar, 
gas turbine) or by size of the facility. Some utilities 
with interconnection procedures evaluate projects by 
size. Thus, our report adopts this protocol, and we 
address three size ranges of distributed power 
projects, as follows:        
•  1 MW and Greater           
•  25 kW to 1 MW           
•  Up to 25 kW. 
Each case study is organized to report the 
background of the project (with confidential 
information deleted), benefits of the project, barriers 
to market entry, costs associated with the barriers, 
and the utilityís stance when available. In each case 
study, we classify the barriers to market entry as 
follows: 
•  Technical interconnection barriers                       
•  Business practice barriers                
•  Regulatory barriers. 
The factual information in these case studies is 
derived principally from interviews with the 
developers and owners of these distributed power 
facilities. Although we made efforts to confirm key 
facts with other stakeholders, particularly the 
interconnecting utilities, these narratives remain in 
effect the distributed generatorsí narratives. Not all 
the information provided could be independently 
verified. Thus, these case studies primarily represent 
the developersí view of the situations they 
encountered in seeking to interconnect their facilities. 
We viewed our task as reporting the barriers they 
described, not assessing the legitimacy of their 
concerns. Therefore, the case studies reported here      
may not reflect what might be a very different utility 
position with respect to some of the cases. 
3.1 Individual Case Study Narratives for 
Large Distributed Power Projects 
(One MW and Greater) 
This section provides a detailed description of eight 
larger distributed power installations. Barriers to 
entry into the market place changed as the facilities 
installed increased in size. Developers and vendors 
installing larger projects tended to be different than 
those installing smaller projects, as did the customers. 
Larger distributed power facilities (one MW and

of organizations that might include:                     
•  Large commercial users                 
•  Large industrial users               
•  Generation companies           
•  Distribution companies            
•  Municipalities  
•  Cooperatives. 
In our study, we interviewed 16 organizations that 
installed, are planning to install, or attempted to 
install distributed power between one and 10 MW in 
size. We also interviewed six organizations with 
generation greater than 10 MW.66 Of these projects, 
13 are for municipalities, city/community facilities, 
or utilities. 
Larger projects tend to serve specific types of 
applications such as CHP67 projects. CHP projects are 
typically primarily connected as baseload facilities 
because many times the need for heat or steam cannot 
be supplied from another source. In those cases, the 
electricity is generated independent of system peak. 
66 We did not seek out distributed power projects larger 
than 100 megawatts because the issues of customer access 
or transmission access invoke different technical and other 
considerations. 
67 Cogeneration is the production of steam in conjunction 
with electricity. The steam is used for an alternative source 
such as hot water heating or processes. This is also referred 
to as CHP or combined heat and power. 
40 
Ten of the sixteen projects from 1 MW to 10 MW are 
CHP, and four are methane gas-to-energy projects.

Case #1 ó 26 MW Gas Turbine 
Cogeneration Project in Louisiana 
Background 
The industrial customer had contracted with a 
distributed generation developer to build a 26-MW 
gas turbine cogeneration plant at its production 
facility. The plant was scheduled to be on-line in 
November 1999, at which point the industrial 
customer planned to disconnect from the utility 
distribution grid. The project includes six 5.2 MW 
turbines with synchronous generators, five of which 
would run continuously, and one of which would be 
reserved for duty during planned and unplanned 
outages of the primary units. Each of these units had 
100,000 lb/hr boilers on heat recovery to achieve 92 
percent thermal efficiency.                         
Once the installation is completed, the industrial 
customerís primary benefits will be on-site 
generation of electricity and steam. The new gas 
turbines will provide a dramatic reduction in carbon 
dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissions by replacing 
the old, less efficient, boilers. The industrial customer 
will enjoy much higher power reliability than from 
the utility grid. 
Regulatory Barriers 
Discount Tariffs 
The greatest barrier to building this cogeneration 
facility was the utilityís existing and regulatoryagency-approved 
steam user subsidy. This subsidy 
allows the utility to offer discount rates to customers 
who use steam; the more steam they use the greater 
the discount available. 
The utility invoked this subsidy, offering seven- to 
ten-year long discount rate contracts to retain 
customers who were intending to build their own 
cogeneration facilities. The utilityís annual lost 
revenue from this cogeneration project would be 
approximately $8.8 million for electric loads alone. 
Environmental Permitting 
Another hurdle in the approval process for this plant 
was the air emissions permit. The state air regulatory 
board appears inconsistent from case to case and area 
to area. In this case, the old boilers being replaced 
were fired on #6 diesel. The developer proposed to 
burn much cleaner natural gas, but the state air 
regulatory board position was that as a ìnewî source 
the facility must meet 99 percent improved 
efficiency. Ninety-percent improved efficiency was 
not sufficient. No credit was given to the industrial 
customer for taking out the old, less efficient boilers. 
Estimated Costs 
The industrial customerís cost to overcome these 
barriers was estimated at $2 million. 
Distributed Generatorís Proposed Solutions

these sources to reduce the confusion and difficulty 
inherent in the current approval process. In addition, 
larger project developers consistently recommended 
that uniform standby rates be approved. Another 
benefit of distributed generation is the ability to 
reduce peak demands on utility systems; yet, 
distributed generators do not receive credit in standby 
rates for this benefit.

Background 
An industrial customer contracted with a distributed 
generation developer to build a 20.8-MW gas turbine 
cogeneration plant at its Texas production facility. 
Two of the 5.2-MW gas turbines were started in 
August 1999, and two more were brought on-line in 
September 1999. Each unit had a synchronous 
generator and a 100,000-lb/hr boiler on heat recovery 
to achieve 92 percent thermal efficiency. The 
turbines run continuously to reduce the plantís peak 
demand and energy use. The customer decided to 
interconnect the turbines in parallel operation to the 
grid to provide voltage stability while starting up 
1,000 hp motors and other large plant loads. 
The developer believed the local utility tried to stop 
the installation at every turn with delay tactics and 
reduced rate incentives. The industrial customer 
signed a reduced rate contract in 1996 or 1997 
because of short-term financial savings, but recently 
bought itself out of the contract at a cost of 
approximately $1 million to proceed with the 
cogeneration plant installation. The industrial 
customerís financial priorities shifted as its demand 
for steam increased over time. The customer also 
hoped to avoid the low voltage problems and outages 
it experienced on the utility grid during the peaks of 
summer. It finally elected to proceed with building 
the cogeneration plant without the utilityís approval, 
ending what had been a ten-year delay since the 
inception of the project.                           
Next year, as its operating load changes, the 
industrial customer will be a net producer of energy 
and plans to sell it back to the grid. The utility plans 
to pay the industrial customer its avoided generation 
cost of about 2¢/kWh (fluctuating), which is lower 
than the customerís generation cost. 
The industrial customerís primary benefits will be 
on-site generation of electricity and steam. However, 
the new gas turbines will provide a dramatic 
reduction in carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides 
emissions by replacing the old, less-efficient and 
more polluting boilers. In addition, the industrial 
customer will enjoy higher power reliability than that 
provided by the utility grid. 
Regulatory Barriers 
Discount Tariffs 
The greatest barrier to building this cogeneration 
facility was the utilityís use of undisclosed discounts. 
The utility invoked this subsidy, offering confidential 
seven- to ten-year discount rate contracts to retain the 
customer who was intending to build its own 
cogeneration facilities. The utilityís annual lost 
revenue from this cogeneration project will be in the 
millions for electric loads alone. This was the 
principal hurdle in this case. The industrial customer 
and the vendor were able to clear the air emissions 
hurdle easily because the air control board credited 
them for removing the old, less efficient boilers.

Background 
This new 15-MW steam and electric combined-heatand-power 
plant is located on the site of one of the 
first electric plants in the countryóthe source of 
42 
power for the first electrified Worlds Fair held in St. 
Louis in 1904. The plant later added steam recovery 
to supply district steam heating to the city. 
Through the 1980s the plant operated as a 70-MW 
peaking facility before its shutdown and sale by the 
utility. The current owner bought the site and 
installed two synchronous generators, each powered 
by a backpressure steam turbine and a new gas 
turbine. 
The system achieves approximately 70 percent 
energy efficiency by combining steam production for 
district heating with electricity production. The steam 
turbines recover excess steam pressure from the 
steam system to power each generator to about 2.5 
MW of capacity, and the gas turbines power the 
remaining 5 MW for a total of 15 MW of generation. 
In the winter with higher turbine efficiencies and 
more steam use the capacity rises to about 17 MW. 
The project owner first approached the utility in June 
1998 with a requested start date for the project of 
June 1, 1999. The utility required the same technical 
and operating requirements that it would apply to 
large utility-owned generation facilities 10 to 100 
times the size, including the right to operate it as part 
of the utility system. The utility requested system 
upgrades the developer believed not appropriate or 
feasible for a small merchant plant. Similarly, 
requests for operating control of the units from the 
utility control center failed to recognize competitive 
market operation and relative size of the unit. 
Although relatively large in terms of distributed 
power, the 15-MW combined heat-and-power facility 
here did not rise to the level of the one-percent 
metering error of the 2,000-MW coal plant operated 
by the utility forty miles away. When repeatedly 
confronted on the inappropriateness of the 
interconnection demands, the utility dropped some of 
the requirements to allow the project to proceed. 
Nonetheless, the technical interconnection 
requirements ultimately imposed added more than 
one million dollars to the cost of the project and 
delayed approval. 
The developer also pointed out its perception of the 
differences between the utility project approach and a 
competitive market approach. For example, the utility 
was not amenable to overtime or additional expense     
to meet the interconnection deadline ó even when 
the developer offered to pay for it. On the other hand, 
with respect to capital investment the utility many 
times proposed a higher-priced technical approach 
such as building a three-million-dollar substation, 
rather than looking at more effective lower cost 
options such as co-location and interconnection at the 
existing substation. 
Further, the ability of the utility to recover its 
expenses in developing its interconnection policies 
was also felt to be unfair. In this case the nearby 
available substation requested by the developer for 
interconnection would have given any new generator 
direct distribution access to industrial and urban 
customers in a restructured market, without resort to 
transmission line reservation and fees. As ultimately 
configured, the interconnection steps the generation 
up to the transmission system and eliminates direct 
distribution access to such potential competitors of 
the utility. 
Business Practice Barriers 
Procedural Requirements for Interconnection 
The interconnection approval was punctuated with 
cumulative procedural delays. For example, it was 
reported that the utility volunteered to take minutes 
of the meetings and then produced none over the 
course of many meetings. The developer eventually 
took over the responsibility for minutes after noting 
the delays. Telephone calls to the utility were 
reportedly met with repeated responses of ìcall next 
week.î In what we found to be a common experience, 
midway through the process the utility changed 
representatives, resulting in weeks of no response, 
and ultimately direct dealings with operating line 
personnel were required to circumvent the impasse. 
The developer also reported that several months 
before the June 1999 projected start date, the utility 
gave notice that a transmission line pole 
interconnection was near its yield point. A new, 
specific pole was required, which would take six 
months for delivery. The developer believed that the 
additional load of a short slack interconnection line 
was minimal compared to multiple spans of heavy 
transmission cable already on the pole. When asked 
for the new pole specifications for justification, the 
utility allowed interconnection with reinforcement to 
43 
the existing pole. Similarly, with respect to what 
breakers would be required, the utility did not 
provide specifications. When presented with a 
breaker from another location, the utility claimed that 
it could not be used at the proposed site. When the 
developer presented the manufacturerís certification, 
the breaker was allowed. 
The utility did not commence work until the last 
week of May 1999, far too late for completion by 
June 1, 1999. The utilityís initial position was that no 
transmission hook-up could occur during the highdemand 
summer months, and thus interconnection 
would need to wait until fall. However, as capacity 
limits appeared as the summer peak approached, the 
utility agreed to interconnect, which it did by July 14, 
1999. The utility accepted the power immediately at 
the PURPA buyback rate of 1.5¢/kWh, but restricted 
sales into the market to other buyers until remote 
reading meters were in place to allow the utility to 
monitor the ownerís generation remotely. Those 
remote signaling meters were installed by July 23, 
1999, at which time market sales began. The system 
has been in operation since that time. 
Contractual Requirements for Interconnection 
The developer asked for a draft contract at the start of 
the negotiations in June 1998. The first draft was 
provided in April 1999. Among the utility control 
provisions included in the draft contract was the right 
to take over remote operation of the plant when 
system conditions demanded. This and similar 
provisions, which had been common under the 
natural monopoly regulatory environment, were the 
principal subjects of negotiations, rather than one 
including the needs of merchant plant operation and 
market response. 
The contract provisions required redrafting to 
recognize the shift away from utility ownership and 
control to market operation. For example, the utility 
cited its need for control of supply grid operations 
under an ISO, overriding competitive interests in the 
developer in meeting that supply need. The language 
that was ultimately adopted allowed dispatch of the 
plant in a system emergency, not otherwise defined, 
with the owner reimbursed for costs. The market 
value and payment for this generation are not 
otherwise defined. As indicated above, the utilityís 
request for direct digital remote control of the          
merchant plant was ultimately negotiated down to 
remote meter access. 
Technical Barriers 
The developer believed that the technical 
requirements were also imposed to discourage the 
installation. The developer initially proposed tying 
into the utility substation located three blocks away 
from the project site. The nearby substation had 
existing duct banks already in place for underground 
interconnection, operated at the 13.8-kV generation 
voltage, and directly served downtown and industrial 
loads. For two months, the utility attempted to direct 
the project to a more distant substation through old 
feeder lines operating under a river flood plain not 
suitable for reliable access and operation. Moreover, 
the developer was concerned that the condition of the 
aging equipment at that substation would entail 
higher operation and maintenance costs for the life of 
the project. 
When the developer refused the distant 
interconnection, the utility estimated a cost of 
$2.5 million to modify the nearby substation, 
claiming all breakers would need to be replaced to 
handle the capacity. The developer proposed colocation 
of new transformers at the same site to make 
use of interconnection and 13.8 kV access, but was 
refused. As a consequence, the developer was 
required to build a new substation with underground 
access and transformers to enter at the transmission 
level. 
The utility quoted a cost of $3 million and two years 
to build the substation. The developer chose to build 
the new substation in six months, keeping to the June 
1999 projected schedule, at a cost of $1.7 million ó 
more than $1 million less than the utility quote and 
$0.8 million less than the utility estimate for direct 
interconnection at the nearby substation. However, 
the required cost was $1 million dollars more than the 
preferred nearby 13.8-kV access that the developer 
believed would have been acceptable with new 
transformers. 
Finally, after completion of the substation, the utility 
tied in the three-phase feeder lines with system 
protection relays on each end with costs to be billed 
to the developer based on a good-faith estimate of 
$240,000. 

44 
Utility Position 
The utility representative stated that the utility 
currently had distributed power as well as 
independent power producer projects in its service 
territory. The representative stated that the utility had 
established contact procedures and personnel to 
process distributed power applications. The utility 
accepted Underwriters Laboratories (UL) and 
Institute of Electrical Engineers & Electronics (IEEE) 
certified equipment for interconnection, but also test 
trips verification relays as well. The utility also 
required installation of their own remote 
disconnection control and the customer was 
responsible for all safety testing expenses. 
The utility did not have any rate reduction programs 
for customers who sought rate relief, but did have an 
experimental tariff in place to shave peak loads on 
high load days. The experimental tariff can reduce 
the demand charges for the customer reduction of 
peak loads. 
The utility charged no exit fees or Competitive 
Transition Charges (CTCs) in Missouri, but did have 
a standby service charge for customers who chose to 
self-generate to reduce their demand and energy use. 
Customers who chose to generate excess capacity and 
sell it back to the market, must either sell this power 
directly to the utility at a standard buy back rate or 
pay an uplift charge to move the power to the 
transmission system, as well as transmission charges.

Background 
A distributed-power equipment supplier in New York 
sought to install a cogeneration facility for an 
industrial client. The client wanted to operate this 10-    
MW plant on a continuous basis, fully disconnected 
from the grid with a full back-up power system. This 
facility included a 3-MW duel fuel combustion 
turbine with a 200-kW back-pressure turbine. It also 
had three 2.2-MW duel-fuel reciprocating engines 
that supplied 20,000 lbs/ hour of 400-psig 
superheated steam for heat recovery. The distributed 
power equipment supplier worked with the client for 
two years to develop plans for the proposed 
cogeneration facility. 
The local electric distribution company was aware of 
the negotiations between the customer and the 
equipment supplier and wanted to retain the customer 
and its $6-7 million per year revenue stream. The 
utility made a total of 25 separate proposals over the 
two-year period to undercut the offers of the 
distributed power equipment supplier. The local 
regulatory agency also became involved in the effort 
to keep this customer on the grid. The special 
discount rate contract the utility and regulatory 
agency finally offered the customer undercut the rate 
of return and guaranteed savings offered by the 
distributed power equipment supplier, causing the 
customer to abandon the project. 
Project Benefits 
The industrial customer would have benefited from 
the proposed cogeneration plant by using the 
electricity and steam produced on site for its entire 
load, heating, preheating hot water, and other 
industrial processes. It would have been able to 
produce its own electricity and steam at a much lower 
cost than its pre-discount avoided purchase price. The 
environmental benefit of using cogeneration at this 
facility would have been a combination of replacing 
the old high-NOx output boilers with highly efficient 
gas turbines and displacing the fossil-fired electric 
load and associated transmission losses. The 
developer noted that the loss of these benefits will be 
compounded over time as the current system 
continues to pay for less efficient higher-pollutant 
technology in place of the cleaner combined-cycle 
generation technology. 
45 
Regulatory Barriers 
Discount Tariffs 
The primary barrier to the success of this project was 
the combined effort between the local power 
distribution company and the power transmission 
company to undercut the 20-year power rate 
guaranteed by the distributed power equipment 
supplier. It was reported that the utility had initially 
tried unsuccessfully to dissuade the customer from 
building the cogeneration plant on its own for at least 
a year before involving the regulatory agency. The 
utility was able to use its discount tariff to offer a 
deeply discounted three-year rate incentive to the 
customer. This tariff allowed the utility to offer lower 
rates to retain an electric customer under the ìPower 
for Jobsî program approved by the New York State 
Legislature. This program provides lower cost 
electricity to businesses and not-for-profit 
organizations that agree to retain or create jobs in 
New York State. 
During the bidding process, the customer became 
aware of the utilityís determination to retain its load. 
The customer then used this leverage to bid the utility 
and the distributed power supplier against one 
another to negotiate the best possible deal for its 
power. In the final hours of contract negotiation 
between the equipment supplier and the customer, the 
utility presented the combined offer it had arranged 
with the regulatory agency to persuade the customer 
to abandon the cogeneration project. 
The regulatory agency further blocked the cogeneration 
project by approving transport rates for 
natural gas to the proposed cogeneration facility 
(through its gas distribution system) that were nine 
times higher than the utility charged itself. 
Distributed Generatorís Proposed Solutions 
The developer recognized that, for some customers, 
this case scenario provides them special 
benefitsdiscounts not ordinarily available in a 
monopoly market. They enjoy long-term discounted 
electric rates with the utility until the incentive plans 
expire, then they either renegotiate a better contract 
or reawaken the cogeneration facility plans. The 
competitive supplier, however, felt that it had to 
confront monopoly market power in collaboration       
with the regulatory authority in a kind of public 
subsidy of the status quo. 
Utility Position 
The utility was contacted and answered several 
questions regarding its position on distributed power 
and related issues. The following information was as 
related by the utility representative. 
The utility was concerned that no acceptable national 
interconnection standard currently exists and expects 
a national standard to simplify matters. At this time, 
the utility used Appendix A of NY state 
requirements. The utility stated that complications 
existed because the grid and all protection systems 
were initially designed for unidirectional power flow, 
not bi-directional or multiple outlying sources. 
For installations under 300 kW, the utility was most 
concerned with anti-islandingensuring that the 
system would auto disconnect during periods of 
instability and fluctuations. For systems larger than 
300 kW, especially above 1 MW, the utility was 
concerned about having control over the distributed 
power source so that it could remotely monitor all 
facets of customer generation and load. The utility 
believed that it must be able to disconnect the 
generator, if necessary, or change the operating 
characteristics during frequency and voltage 
fluctuations. 
The utility required an engineering review for 
interconnected distributed power systems and type 
testing of the components involved. The utility had 
standard interconnection agreements for both large 
and small generators.

Background 
A distributed power equipment supplier in the 
Northeast sought to install a cogeneration facility for 
a hospital client. The client wanted to operate this 5MW 
plant on a continuous basis to provide base-load 
generation and cover foreseeable demand peaks. The 
facility was to include a 5-MW dual-fuel combustion 
turbine. This turbine was to supply a heat-recovery 
steam generator producing 70,000 lbs/hour of 200psig 
superheated steam. The hospital intended to 
retire several old boilers by installing the new 
cogeneration plant, as well as use the low-grade 
steam for absorption chilling. The small plant size 
and reliability needs of the hospital required parallel 
operation to the grid. Ultimately, the high charges 
levied by the utility for backing up the full plant 
capacity caused the hospital to abandon this project. 
The utility would have lost an estimated $850,000 per 
year in revenue from the customer. 
This hospital would have benefited from the 
proposed cogeneration plant by using all the 
electricity and steam produced on site for base load, 
heating, preheating hot water, and driving absorption 
chillers. It would have been able to produce its own 
electricity and steam at a much lower cost than its 
avoided purchase price had the high standby charges 
not been levied. Finally, there would have been a 
significant environmental benefit from the increased 
efficiency of using cogeneration at this facility, 
resulting from a combination of replacing the old 
heating boilers with highly efficient gas turbines, 
using the otherwise wasted low-grade heat, and 
displacing other fossil-fired electric load and 
associated transmission losses. 
Regulatory Barriers 
Back-up Tariff 
The primary barrier to the success of this project was 
the back-up tariff imposed by the local utility. The 
utility required a reservation of the full 5 to 6 MW of 
plant capacity for the entire year at a cost of 
$1 million, even though the hospital would have 
provided a benefit to the utility system in the form of 
back-up capacity for use by the utility. (The power 
system design would have allowed the hospital to run 
independently from the grid during local power 
outages or capacity limits.) The utility was unwilling    
to offer a partial credit for the back-up power system 
in place at the hospital. 
Environmental Permitting 
The cogeneration plant at this hospital would have 
been classified as a ìmajor sourceî of environmental 
pollutants. The air permitting process for a ìminor 
sourceî cogeneration facility can last six to nine 
months, and for a ìmajor sourceî the process can last 
up to two years. Many customers and vendors 
seeking to self-generate are not willing to invest the 
time and financial resources in the permitting process 
itself and the resulting regulations for the installation 
at their facilities. 
Estimated Costs 
The annual back-up tariff was to be $1 million 
dollars, which was expensive for this project and 
expensive on a capacity basis (~$16/kW-month). The 
costs of the environmental testing and permitting 
process were also expected to be quite highó 
although more difficult to estimate because the cost is 
primarily the time spent to address the requirements. 
Distributed Generatorís Proposed Solutions 
The equipment supplier that we interviewed for this 
case study suggested that the industry regulators 
adopt output-based emission standards to recognize 
the benefit of cogeneration in combining generation 
process efficiency and utility as well as reducing fuel 
consumption and displacing the pollutants of 
inefficient boilers. Such an approach would not only 
recognize the efficient production of electricity from 
the turbine generator, but also the utility of the 
combustion waste heat as it is applied and conserved 
in its facility. Without this evaluation system, the 
customer is evaluated on the basis of total NOx 
emissions for the year and emissions at short test 
intervals to the power produced, without crediting for 
high efficiency provided by the steam and heat 
recovery processes. 
Utility Position 
The utility was contacted and answered several 
questions regarding its position on distributed power 
and related issues. The following information is as 
related by the utility representative. 
47 
The customer is not prohibited from producing power 
as long as it passes emission standards and meets 
safety requirements. The utilityís Distribution 
Engineering Department must approve the system 
plans. The utility is only concerned with the safety 
and reliability of the interconnection and the grid 
itself.

that was provided wholesale power from two G&T 
utilities. The co-op had not previously owned any 
generating assets. The cost of generation and 
transmission was $6.54/kW-month for demand and 
3.4¢/ kWh for energy from the G&T contracts. In 
addition, there was a 65 percent demand ratchet for 
12 months. Its typical summer peak demand was 
170 MW; thus, its peak demand for the next 12 
months was 110 MW (65 percent of 170 MW) even 
though its base load was 40-50MW. 
In areas of relatively flat demand, this would not be a 
problem; however, this distribution utility 
experienced its peak load only during a six- to 
twelve-week irrigation season. Load could change 
very rapidly as heavy rains moved through the area 
because the majority of the load was from irrigation 
pumps and equipment. Thus, 90 MW of demand 
could disappear within one hour on a system with a 
40- to 50-MW base load and a 170-MW peak. 
As a result, the distribution utility began to consider 
ways to reduce the peak load in the summer months. 
In addition, voltage regulation was an issue because 
of the nature of its customer load. The distribution 
utility must maintain a 95-percent power factor, 
although it strives for 100 percent. The distribution 
utility believed that adding generation to its grid 
would help keep its power factor closer to unity and 
would increase grid stability.                       
The utility was under a Full Requirements contract 
with its G & Tís, which did not allow it to generate 
power as a wholesaler. It had PURPA (the Public 
Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978) qualified 
facility (QF) status, but it would have preferred 
independent power producer (IPP) status where the 
distribution company would be able to produce and 
provide power back to the G&T at more acceptable 
buy back rates than allowed for QFs. Thus, the 
distribution utility chose to become a partial 
requirements wholesale customer by yearís end. The 
distribution utility will combine several power supply 
contracts, exercise a load management program, and 
purchase some peaking requirements from the 
market. Meanwhile, it is studying how distributed 
power could augment or enhance its load 
management program and control risk management. 
The distribution utility did have a demand peak 
shaving program, including any-time-of-day 
interruption and every-other-day interruption. This 
allowed the farmers to select interruption schedules 
for specific days of the week. Typical savings of 
around 10 percent were provided to customers as 
rebates at the end of the year. However, the savings 
varied from year to year. Exact customer rebate 
amounts were not specified when a customer joined 
the program. The G&T utility allocated a specified 
amount to be rebated to customers each year. If more 
customers entered the program, the rebate might be 
lower. 
To begin efforts to install its own generation, the 
distribution utility experimented with 130-kW 
installations independent from the grid. The 
installations were able to produce the distributed 
power cheaper than the generation and transmission 
costs at 3.3¢/kWh, even with natural gas generation. 
These projects were separate from the specific 1.2MW 
project discussed in this case study, but it is 
noteworthy that the distribution utility installed other 
projects as well. 
To increase these efforts, the distribution utility 
started a project that was funded by the Gas Research 
Institute with assistance from its gas supplier and 
Texas Tech University. This project was a skidmounted 
natural-gas turbine based on a helicopter 
engine with a capacity of 1.2 MW. The engine was 
said to have excellent dynamic capability from full 
48 
load to zero to full load again in a very short period 
of time (about a minute). 
The generation was synchronous with solid-state 
controls specifically designed for distributed 
applications. The controls were provided as a 
package for $55,000, including a 3000-amp bus, 
buses to control the breakers, and relays, which 
communicate with both the unit and the distribution 
utility. The unit side relays allowed for a soft load 
(slower ramp up and cool down) and the relays on the 
utility side provided for protection of single-phase 
faults, phase-to-phase faults, and the identification of 
zone faults. It also allows remote operation by the 
distribution utility. In addition, software provided by 
the control supplier as part of the package monitors 
the kW, kWh, KVA, power factor failures, and 
reasons for power failures. With these controls, the 
size of the unit could be increased to 2 MW without 
any additional modifications. 
The unit was interconnected parallel to the grid twothirds 
of the way out on a radial distribution line 
serving homes and farms in the region. There were 
250 meters on the line, mostly three-phase, and 20 
percent of the customers were residential. This 
particular distribution substation could experience 
daily loads as high as 10 MW during irrigation 
season and as low as 1 MW other times. 
The project started operation in September 1999. The 
unit will initially be operated for 2,000 hours for 
testing purposes and then would be able to operate 
when needed in the summer 
From a technical standpoint, the installation went 
smoothly under very detailed technical specifications 
from the utility for installation of the generator. The 
distribution utility was required to provide a 
protective breaker at the 69 kV line to feed the 12 kV 
distribution line from the G&T. 
Project Benefits 
In addition to reduced peak demand, the distribution 
utility installation also stabilized the grid and 
improved the power factor with this project. The unit 
was installed to maximize the stability of the grid. 
From a global standpoint, there were avoided 
transmission and distribution costs, especially when 
considering the varying load on the circuit.            
In addition, the project can generate power at a cost 
of 4.5¢/kWh (1.5¢/kWh for operations and 
maintenance costs and 3.0¢/kWh for fuel). Power 
costs to the distribution utility were higher when 
supplied by the G&T. 
During the irrigation off-season, some of the power 
flows back to the substation from the distributed 
power installation and out the other three distribution 
lines on that substation. As discussed above, the 
distribution utility was interested in supplying part of 
its own generation. The utility was operating under 
the philosophy that its generating assets should be as 
liquid as possible in order to be flexible and allow for 
change in the future as the customers needs change. 
The distribution utility expected to invest $80 million 
over the next 10 years to improve and build a flexible 
distribution system. 
Business Practice Barriers 
Contractual Barriers to Interconnection 
The key barrier for the distribution utility is that it is 
currently under a Full Requirements contract as 
discussed above and cannot become a wholesale 
power producer under this contract. Selling to the 
G&T utility produced only 1.7¢/kWh for energy as 
against a cost to generate of 4.5¢/kWh. The Public 
Utility Commission (PUC) was aware of the 
situation, and as a result of PUC involvement, the 
G&T utility is considering a potential incentive rate 
instead of the 1.7¢/kWh rate that will apply only to 
this project. The unit started up in September, 
although a higher rate had not yet been negotiated 
and the project would only be allowed to sell to the 
G&T at the 1.7¢/kWh. The 1.7¢/kWh buyback rate 
was a historical rate based on wind projects that have 
been installed in the past. 
Fortunately, because the distributed power developer 
was the distribution company, there were no standby 
charges associated with the project. However, if the 
unit was not allowed to generate revenue by selling 
power back into the grid at a reasonable rate during 
non-irrigation peak times, further projects would not 
be economic. Since the distribution utility would like 
to install at least 10 MW of generation at a weak 
point in its grid system, this becomes a critical issue. 
49 
Distributed Generatorís Proposed Solutions 
The key solution would be for the distribution utility 
to be allowed to become a wholesale generator that 
can sell its power on the wholesale market. The 
distribution utility is taking a local and flexible 
approach to resolving grid stability problems and 
would prefer to continue to install distributed power 
locally. However, the contractual and tariff issues 
must be resolved before the effort to install 
distributed power can continue.

Background 
A city in Massachusetts contracted with a developer 
to investigate operation of a 1-MW reciprocating 
engine and generator on recovered landfill methane 
(currently being flared from the community landfill) 
to supply part of the 2 MW local municipal load. The 
municipal load delivery points were between zero 
and eight miles from the landfill generation site, 
connected by a distribution line operating at 13 kV. 
The proposed project had not been installed yet. 
With this installation, the community would be able 
to meet half of its electrical needs by utilizing a 
currently wasted resource. The power would be 
generated at or very near the point of use, would be 
low cost, would provide stability to the distribution 
line, would reduce the losses in the transmission and 
distribution (T&D) network, and would provide 
enhanced capacity on the regional transmission grid. 
Regulatory Barriers 
Independent System Operators (ISO) Requirements 
and T&D Tariffs 
The most significant barriers to installation of this 
project were the tariffs for transmission and            
distribution. Even though the proposed project would 
be serving local loads within a single distribution 
area, it would still be subject to the following tariffs 
under the following current regulatory structure:                              
•  Local distribution tariffs                 
•  Full regional transmission costs                       
•  Penalties for losses            
•  Operating charges under ISO rules. 
An ìuplift tariffî charge for wheeling the power 
through the local distribution and transmission 
system to the regional pooled facilities was assessed. 
The uplift tariff applied was the transmission 
companyís non-ISO tariff: ìOpen Access 
Transmission Tariff for Transmission and Ancillary 
Services Not Provided Under the New England 
Power Pool (NEPOOL) Open Access Transmission 
Tariff.î It was to be assessed regardless of the fact 
that the power was generated and used locally. For 
this project, the transmission company might make 
an exception and the tariff might not be assessed. 
However, for future projects these issues have not 
been addressed and other similar projects could be 
assessed an uplift tariff. In years past, this tariff was 
approximately $5/kW-month plus losses of eight 
percent or more (discussed below). 
The transmission company also had an alternative 
ìpoint-to-pointî transmission tariff, which required 
interval metering and telemetering of data to 
NEPOOL, which made it more expensive than local 
distribution system service. The ìpoint-to-pointî 
transmission service was $1.79/kW-month for both 
firm and non-firm service. 
Losses were assigned to the retail load on the 
assumption that they were being served from the Pool 
Transmission Facility (PTF) level, and required five 
to nine percent more generation delivered than load 
served depending on the local distribution company 
and interconnection voltage of the customer served 
(the higher the service voltage, the lower the losses 
applied). Local loads served by local generation 
(within the same distribution system) were assessed 
the same level of losses as loads served by generation 
connected to the NEPOOL pooled transmission 
facilitiesóeven though part of their competitive 
advantage was reduction or elimination of such 
losses. In other words, capacity on the distribution 
50 
system serving local loads, which reduced 
transmission loads into that system from NEPOOL 
were assumed to experience the same losses as 
capacity actually being carried from outside the 
distribution system. There were no provisions for 
credit or value for reduced losses on the distribution 
or transmission systems and reduced power import as 
a result of distributed power. 
Estimated Costs 
For the specific case considered here, where most of 
the customers were small- to medium-sized 
municipal end-users, the losses assessment equaled 
nine percent of the load served. 
In addition, distributed power was charged additional 
ìassumedî losses from two to eight percent 
depending on the interconnection voltage. In this 
case, the calculated loss would be around five 
percent, thus the total charged losses for the project 
would be 14 percent. 
Distributed Generatorís Proposed Solutions 
Currently in the ISO-NE settlement system, 
distributed power less than 1 MW in capacity cannot 
be readily accounted for. As a result, the local 
supplier would need to attach the accounting to the 
current system supplier (or a system supplier) and 
treat this size class of distributed resources as a 
ìnegative load,î or adjustment to the main account. 
As a result of this negative load treatment, a 
distributed resource actually receives credit at the 
PTF level for metered generation plus losses (i.e., a 
900-kW facility receives credit for an extra 54 kW 
for losses avoided). This treatment is very much the 
exception rather than the rule, and ISO-NE is 
apparently considering whether to retain this 
treatment of small resources as it moves forward. The 
situation has not been resolved. 
The state and PUC need to address the procedures 
and charges by which distributed power can enter the 
wholesale T&D market consistent with the smaller 
size and more local system impacts. 
Utility Position 
We contacted the utility several times to obtain its 
position on distributed power and related issues. We     
were directed to other individuals with each phone 
call, and the correct individual was never identified.

Background 
Certain regions in the Rocky Mountains are known 
for rugged terrain and remote access, as well as 
proximity to national forests and wilderness areas. In 
recent years, the population and recreational use of 
these areas has increased and, as a result, the amount 
of energy and capacity required for the region has 
increased. In the winter, the community in this case 
study required 26 MW of peak capacity, projected to 
increase to 40-46 MW by 2019. Summer peak was 
half that amount. 
A large industrial user and a commercial user, at the 
request of their local distribution utility, sought to 
reduce their peak load by installing peak-shaving 
capacity and by backing down power during peak 
periods. These customers were prompted to 
investigate peak shaving by virtue of a ìThree-Phaseî 
incentive rate structure from the distribution utility. 
The tariff included a coincident peak demand charge 
of approximately $14.00/kW-month and a noncoincident 
peak demand charge of approximately 
$7.00/kW-month. The charge for energy was reduced 
to $0.033/kWh under this demand charge tariff. 
The standard customer tariff from the distribution 
utility with demand metering is $9/kW-month for all 
kW over 20 kW per month. The standard tariff for 
energy was $0.047/kWh. Under this arrangement 
peak shaving with on-site generation could 
significantly reduce demand charges. 
Initially, the industrial user was approached by the 
distribution utility to install back-up and peakshaving 
capacity at its facility. The facility already 
51 
had a small back-up generator. The utility was 
instituting a peak-shaving incentive program that 
would allow it to reduce its overall peak wholesale 
purchases under its all requirements contract with the 
G&T. A letter from the distribution utility to the 
customer outlining the rate tariff for the pilot 
program initially described a rate tariff of $3.50/kWmonth 
for non-coincident peak, $14.62/kW-month 
for coincident peak, and $0.048/kWh for energy. 
In November 1995, the customer purchased and 
installed a 1-MW diesel generator in accordance with 
the distribution utility program. 
The utility imposed control requirements. The 
generator was equipped with an automatic transfer 
switch, allowing the generator to be started and 
transferred from a remote location. The distribution 
utility notified the plant 15 minutes before each peak 
shaving event. The utility starts and stops the 
generator remotely via a signal sent directly over the 
power lines. The generator was operated a maximum 
of 10 hours per month, and only during times 
requested by the utility. The transfer switch does not 
allow parallel operation. 
The commercial user was also approached by the 
utility to enter the incentive program. The incentive 
program was already in place at the other industrial 
facility described above and the rate tariff was 
published. The commercial facility typically had a 
peak load of 1.2 MW but could reduce that load to 
700 kW at any given time using load shedding and 
scheduling techniques (primarily for large chiller 
units). 
Business Practice Barriers 
Procedural Impediments to Interconnection 
The agreement between the industrial facility and the 
utility began as an informal verbal agreement. At the 
time, an incentive rate tariff was not actually 
published by the utility. In exchange for installation 
of the generator, the utilityís letter offer stated the 
industrial facility would be eligible for the $3.50/kWmonth 
incentive rate during non-coincident peak 
demand hours. Based on that representation, the 
customer purchased a generator in November 1995 at 
a cost of $350,000. The customer never entered a 
more formal contract with the utility. In March 1996, 
another utility representative approached the           
customer with a second proposal and a noncoincident 
peak rate of $6.72/kW-month. The reason 
offered for the rate change was the settlement of the 
distribution utilityís rate case that included less 
favorable rates. Notwithstanding the substantial 
investment based on the lower represented rate, the 
utility instituted the higher demand charge incentive 
tariff. 
Even so, there was a delay in implementing the less 
advantageous tariff, which took effect in June 1996, 
six months after the customerís capital investment. 
The savings for the first period from June 18 to 
August 6, 1996, was $5,783. 
Not Allowed to Operate in Parallel 
The industrial customer made an investment in a 1MW 
generator on a site with a monthly peak demand 
typically between 250 to 350 kW. Even with planned 
expansions, the monthly peak demand of this 
customer will not exceed 500 kW. The customer 
sought to operate the generator in parallel with the 
utility system to provide capacity during critical peak 
periods. This was not allowed by the utility. The 
commercial customer likewise had a 750-kW backup 
generator. It also sought to operate the unit in 
parallel to the utility system. However, the utility did 
not allow for parallel operation and prevented use of 
either generator for peak shaving capability, except 
as controlled to operate by the utility. 
Reduced Peak Shaving Under Utility Control 
Changes in the program reduced savings several 
times. The distribution utility uses remote control to 
shed the customer load when it elects to do so. The 
savings to the customer result only when the load 
shedding coincides with the G&T system peak, 
which the distribution utility does not know until 
after the fact. The utility has control over the decision 
to shed peak demand from both the industrial and 
commercial customers. It is not obligated to reduce 
the load; therefore, these customers are billed higher 
coincident peak demand charges if the utility elects 
not to shave the peak. The choice is the utilityís, thus 
these customers are not able to maximize their 
investment return. 
Originally, the commercial customer was saving as 
much as $7,000 per month. After several months of 
52 
operation the savings decreased until the bill reflected 
only a $2,500 per month savings. The customer 
approached the utility about this change. The 
explanation offered was that the G&T changed its 
peak shaving policy to the distribution utility to 
require a 21-MW peak before it allowed peak 
shaving. The change implemented by the G&T 
significantly reduced the benefits of peak shaving to 
the distributed utility, which in turn adjusted its peak 
shaving control to reduce peak shavings to the 
customer. 
Distributed Generatorís Proposed Solutions 
The ability to operate in parallel within fairly (to the 
utility and the customer-owned facility) designed 
tariffs would allow the customers to maximize the 
benefit of the generating capacity in the region. The 
modifications required to allow parallel operation of 
the industrial on-site generation in this example 
would cost approximately $40,000 and would 
provide the ability to reduce the utilityís peak load by 
another 0.75 MW, a modest price for this order of 
capacity addition. 
Properly operated to reduce peak-demand charges, 
the full amount of peak-shaving generation could 
often pay for itself with only a few hundred hours of 
operation at times of peak demand. The utilityís 
preliminary steps toward peak-shaving generation at 
several key facilities in this case study, and the 
proposed incentive through reduced demand charges, 
appear to confirm its conceptual agreement with such 
potential benefits. 
3.2 Individual Case Study Narratives for 
Mid-Size Distributed Power Projects 
(25 kW to 1 MW) 
Several new distributed power technologies have 
entered the market in the 25-kW to 1-MW system 
size in the last decade, including fuel cells, mini- and 
micro-turbines, small wind-turbines, and utility-scale 
solar projects. Twenty-four of the 65 case studies 
conducted were in this range. These systems have 
begun to open commercial markets for the mass 
production of distributed power systems to serve 
specialized customer applications. The ìgreenî 
demand emerging within competitive markets for 
cleaner, renewable, and combined heat-and-power      
options often falls within this size range. However, 
the distributed power solutions for uninterruptible 
back-up supply, peak shaving, and commercial 
energy account management also face barriers that 
some argue hit hardest in this size range. 
Large enough to compete for key commercial energy 
accounts, distributed power systems in this size range 
and larger must compete against traditional one-sizefits-all 
utility service. These systems now offer power 
choices that can be cleaner than the grid, cheaper 
than the grid, and more reliable than the grid in 
particular applications. As a result, increasing 
numbers of vendors and customers are approaching 
distribution utilities for interconnection. 
Unfortunately, our study suggested that the current 
environment can be unpredictable, uncertain, and in 
many cases hostile to the new customer choices 
offered by these technologies. Such a business and 
regulatory environment can create significant barriers 
for particular projects. We believe that these barriers 
are unnecessarily blocking the emergence of a more 
substantial commercial market for these distributed 
power technologies. 
These 10 cases were chosen from the 24 mid-sized 
distributed power examples as a representative cross 
section of the barriers encountered. The selected case 
studies organized by their size are as follows:

Background 
This 703-kW generator was installed in a downtown 
office building to supply building electric loads and 
air conditioning. The generating unit operates on 
steam purchased under a long-term contract from a 
waste-to-energy facility located at the municipal 
waste site one mile away. Since the mid-1980s the 
steam has supplied the building heating and hot water 
loads. The back pressure steam turbine is driven by 
the high steam pressure otherwise lost in the heat 
recovery process at the site. 
This innovative commercial-scale configuration thus 
operates on renewable waste energy at low cost, with 
exemplary operating efficiency. By supplying hot 
water, cooling, and electric loads from the same 
steam supply, the system achieves more than 88 
percent efficiency. Frictional and mechanical losses 
account for most of the remainder. 
The generation is synchronous and intended for 
parallel operation behind local distribution system 
protection at a more than 90 percent capacity factor 
of about 8,000 hours per year. The back pressure 
electric turbine is sized to supply most of the building 
electric and chiller load, with supplemental electricity 
purchased from the utility, and no export or sale of 
electricity to the grid. Two electric-driven coolers 
installed in the building in March 1998, originally 
intended to run off the on-site co-generation unit, 
have been running on utility-supplied power. 
The generator is installed and has been ready for 
operation since September 1998. After significant 
expense, the original technical interconnection 
requirements were met. The initial technical 
requirements were followed, however, by 
unanticipated additional demands for operational       
control by the utility. To minimize further delays, the 
project owner agreed to the Consolidated Edison 
guidelines, which required the installation of 
additional system modifications, monitoring 
equipment, switchgear, back-up systems, and safety 
equipment. These new changes were completed by 
the spring of 1999; however, the unit was still not 
operational as of September 1999. As a result, 
703 kW of available installed capacity remained 
unused, even during record power demand and power 
shortages in the summer of 1999. 
Business Practice Barriers 
Processing Requests 
The project owner first contacted the utility in late 
1997, and negotiations have been underway for 
nearly two years without resolution of 
interconnection issues. As soon as the development 
contract was in place, the developer provided the 
utility with notice and requested information, cost 
estimates, requirements, specifications, and 
schedules. It also provided equipment specifications 
and building specifications. The project owner started 
this process early with the goal of avoiding operating 
delays. 
From the project ownerís perspective, the delays are 
attributable to the absence of utility procedures for 
handling interconnection requests, and from the 
absence of any established approach for resolving 
interconnection disagreements. The parties had 
meetings scheduled every few weeks, but little 
progress was made. Large numbers of utility 
representatives, often ten to twelve at a time, made it 
difficult to schedule meetings and to determine who 
was responsible at the utility. There was apparently 
no viable remedy available from the PUC to handle 
delays. 
Operational Requirements for Interconnection 
After the project owner complied with the initial 
technical requirements for interconnection, the utility 
imposed a set of operational requirements not 
previously raised. This imposed restrictions on the 
project ownerís ability to decide when and how to 
operate the generating facility. For example, one 
operating parameter required that the system be shut 
down if a feeder to the building goes out and gave the 
54 
utility further control over the operation of the 
system. Utility control of this small system was 
contrary to the primary purpose of the system to 
optimize energy production for the customer location. 
Shutting the system down when part of the grid is out 
eliminates the secondary customer value of reliable 
back-up power. The additional operating demands 
were unexpected. The expenditures for 
interconnection and safety equipment were 
incorporated for the purpose of allowing the building 
system to operate independently of the grid when 
such operation was beneficial to the utility. There are 
at present no standards or references for determining 
standard practice or reasonable operating parameters. 
The utility requested the right to control how and 
when to run the equipment, as it might for a much 
larger, utility-owned resource. 
Technical Barriers 
Network Protection Requirements 
Electric service to the building is provided by a 
network distribution system, which serves the City of 
Baltimore. Rather than a radial feed from a local 
distribution substation, the building is served by three 
13.8-kV distribution feeders. Accordingly, the system 
requires protection for the network rather than 
protection for a single radial feeder. 
Perhaps because this was the first distributed-power 
system of its type in Baltimore, the utility appeared to 
be unfamiliar with network interconnection issues 
and expressed concern that reverse flows within the 
network could create system outages over a broader 
area. The utility requested a custom engineering 
design to protect the network from the installation. In 
a network distribution system, protective measures 
seek to isolate one feeder at a time to allow the 
network to continue to operate through the remaining 
feeders. The project owner paid for $44,000 in fees 
incurred by consultants for the utility to design the 
requested network protection. Upon completion, the 
utility expressed dissatisfaction with the result, and 
the effort started anew. 
The consultants then suggested that the project adopt 
existing guidelines developed by Consolidated 
Edison in New York City, which also uses a network 
distribution system. These guidelines were 
burdensome and expensive given the size of the        
installation, but were presented by the utility 
consultants as a way to speed up the interconnection 
process. To minimize further delays, the project 
owner agreed to the Consolidated Edison guidelines, 
which required the installation of additional system 
modifications, monitoring equipment, switchgear, 
back-up systems, and safety equipment. 
Estimated Costs 
The direct costs incurred in meeting the 
interconnection standards were $88,000. These costs 
do not include costs associated with the delays, 
including the loss of energy savings and return on 
investment. 
Utility Position 
The utility was contacted and answered several 
questions regarding its position on distributed power 
and related issues. The following information is as 
related by the utility representative. 
The utility currently has established contacts and 
standard procedures in place to deal with distributed 
power applications, but wishes to improve on these 
procedures and be proactive rather than reactive on 
this issue. The utility anticipates growing interest in 
distributed power. 
The utility recognizes and accepts the UL label, but 
will test at the customerís expense any ìcustomî 
packages, which vary from its preferred packages. 
The utility has engineers who are involved in 
ongoing IEEE activities to develop national 
standards. 
The utility noted that distributed power issues are 
currently being reviewed by the state regulatory 
commission, and changes to its program are likely as 
a result of these discussions. For example any 
customer (with an installation smaller than 80 MW) 
who has a contract in place by September 1999 can 
avoid any stranded-cost charges in the future. Future 
customers will likely be charged for stranded-cost 
recovery, although the utility does not know at this 
time what these stranded costs will be. Legislation 
may result in individual contracts with applicable 
fees or customer specific cases to recover recent 
equipment upgrades that would no longer be 
recoverable in the rate base. 
55 
The utility noted that in distributed power 
applications the customer is still reliant on the grid 
for back-up power. The utility needs appropriate cost 
recovery for this standby service. The cost will be 
driven by deregulation proceedings. The utility had a 
ìbest effortî service category in which the customer 
was allowed to take the risk of not paying for 
standby. If their equipment failed, the customer could 
still ask for backup, but it would not be assured. This 
program did not succeed because all customers 
required assurances of back-up power. The utility 
expects to implement changes to its standby tariff in 
order to place the burden of costs on the distributed 
power customer. 
The utility currently charges a standby service rate 
for parallel interconnected generation, although a 
new rate structure is under development and due for 
publication. The then current tariff provided a 
standby service rate that is a combination of 
generation and distribution. The generation 
component of the standby service charge is 50 
percent of the tariff rate on a flexible schedule 
beginning with 50 percent of generation to be backed 
up, with a demand ratchet that ramps down to 20 
percent, at a rate of 2 percent per month. Drawing on 
standby service increases the rate 1 percent per 
occurrence, subject to monthly decline. The rate is 
100 percent of the generation to be backed up, with 
no declining schedule. The customer may either sell 
excess power directly to the utility or pay an uplift 
charge and transmission charges to sell the power on 
the open market. 
Customers wishing to generate in parallel to the grid 
are required to sign contracts and install appropriate 
technical equipment for selling power back to the 
grid even if they would never generate enough power 
to export. The utility must consider safety first as 
well as ISO requirements. The ISOís main concern is 
the reliability of the power supply.

Background 
This project proposed installation of two 130-kW 
natural gas powered generators at a truck stop in 
Louisiana. The truck stop was expanding to include a 
hotel and gambling casino. The site owner decided to 
install on-site parallel generation as a back-up supply 
to cover frequent periodic outages and standby in 
event of hurricanes or other emergencies. It would 
also cut energy costs. 
The economics of projected energy use at the facility 
showed substantial energy savings from selfgeneration 
on a straight energy basis. The price of 
electricity from the local municipal utility was 
7.4¢/kWh. The proposal included combined electric 
and gas loads for the three facilities, which were 
projected to lower energy costs substantially, and 
contemplated a total of four generating units upon 
completion of the hotel. The facility intended to 
continue to purchase supplemental supply from the 
local municipal utility at about one-third the previous 
level of use. 
The project vendor presented the proposal, which 
included generator, equipment, control and protective 
equipment specifications, to the local municipal 
utility for approval. The city assigned the matter to 
the city engineer, a professional engineer under 
contract to the city. The city engineer approved a 
specific reverse-power interconnection relay and 
informed the vendor there would be no problem with 
parallel operation. The gas vendor reported 
contacting the municipality and confirmed that there 
were no objections. On that basis the vendor 
purchased the generator sets and equipment for 
shipment to the site at a cost in excess of $100,000. 
Construction of concrete mounting pads commenced. 
The week the first unit and interconnection 
equipment were delivered to the site, the city 
engineer called the vendor to propose the addition of 
another synchronization check relay, a relay already 
incorporated in the interconnection equipment 
previously approved by the city. 
Several days later, notice appeared in the Sunday 
newspaper of a new ordinance relating to services, 
rates and charges for electricity, and the ordinance 
was passed by the City on the following day, 
Monday. The ordinance, Appendix B, established 
56 
conditions for ìCustomers who have installed 
equipment and self generate their own primary 
electric services.î The ordinance prohibited parallel 
operation altogether and established a Standby 
Service tariff not previously in existence, which 
included demand and energy charges. The demand 
charges equaled $10.00 per kilowatt-month for the 
first 15 kW and $8.00 per kilowatt-month above 15 
kW with a twelve-month ratchet at 75 percent of that 
charge. The ordinance included a flat monthly fee for 
transformers installed, based on the size calculated at 
$2.00 per KVA. Finally the ordinance included 
power-factor minimums for any customer taking 
service and included rate increases for lagging power 
factors within the minimum acceptable range. 
When contacted regarding the proposed installation, 
the city provided an ìExample Standby Customerís 
Monthly Billî to illustrate the bill amounts that 
would result to the facility for supplemental and 
standby power following installation of the on-site 
generation. The standby rate resulted in a 
supplemental bill, for one-third the power previously 
consumed, roughly equal to the current bill for full 
use. The standby rate applied to full supply during a 
month in which the generators were not operated. It 
was about double the current bill and added 
continuing monthly demand charge for the next 11 
months. 
The new standby service ordinance resulted in the 
project being abandoned, with losses borne by the 
vendors. 
Regulatory Barriers 
Ordinance Prohibiting Parallel Operation 
The developerís investigation into the origin of the 
new ordinance prohibiting parallel connection of selfgeneration 
revealed that the cityís wholesale supplier 
instructed the city to block the proposed customer 
self-generation. The wholesale supplier, a local G&T 
Cooperative, reportedly informed the city that selfgeneration 
threatens the future of the utility and 
would result in higher wholesale rates to the City. 
The G&T apparently drafted the new standby service 
ordinance to block the proposed self-generation, and 
the City passed it to stop the project, which it did. At 
the same time, the cityís consulting engineer was 
given notice that he could no longer serve as the city     
engineer if he provided any private consulting to the 
project. 
Standby Tariff 
Using the demand and energy charges contained in 
the new Standby Tariff, the city calculated the truck 
stopís utility bill for 25,000 kWh of supplemental 
power under the newly enacted tariff at $5,400, as 
compared to a standard bill for 80,000 kWh of 
$6,000. The increase resulted from calculation of 
demand and energy charges imposed by the standby 
service tariff. The higher tariff is applied to the load 
based on the existence of ìinstalled equipment,î 
independent of load profile. A customer with 
equivalent energy usage and profile without such 
equipment on-site would presumably continue to 
receive bills under the standard tariff. 
The stand-by tariff adopted resulted in a significant 
addition to the projected cost of electricity. This 
offset the energy savings from on-site generation, and 
thus rendered the project uneconomic. 
Estimated Costs 
The actions taken by the city after its initial approval 
resulted in project losses being borne by the vendors, 
which included the engine supplier, the gas supplier, 
the operations control vendor, and the project 
contractor. The time of each, valued at $50 per hour, 
amounts to losses in excess of $10,000. Also, based 
on initial city approval, the project contractor had 
purchased two new engine-generator combinations, 
one of which was already on site. The contractor 
expended more than $100,000 in purchasing the 
equipment, some portion of which will be recovered 
by reassembling the systems for other installations. 
In addition, the customer lost the energy savings that 
could have been realized with self-generation. A 
comparison of energy costs from on-site generation 
with the retail utility price indicates a loss on the 
order of $5,000 per month. 
Utility Position 
The utility was contacted regarding their position on 
distributed power and the proposed project. The 
utility representative responded that the utility was 
not interested in answering questions.

Background 
A federal automobile testing facility in Michigan had 
large electricity loads created by 30 air-handling units 
and 3 large chiller units. Its peak demand was 
1.6 MW during the summer and its power factor was 
very low. The lab was in a utility service territory 
with tariffs that included a $19.20/kW-month demand 
charge with a 12-month ratchet. In addition, a power 
factor penalty was applied as follows: 
A penalty of 1 percent of the total bill, for a power 
factor of 80-84.9% 
A penalty of 2 percent of the total bill, for a power 
factor of 75-79.9% 
A penalty of 3 percent of the total bill, for a power 
factor of 70-74.9% 
A penalty of 25 percent of the total bill, for a power 
factor under 74.9 percent for two consecutive 
months. 
The lab had reached the 25-percent penalty on 
several occasions. 
The lab began significant efforts to reduce its energy 
bill. The goal was to reduce its peak load from 1.6 
MW to 800 kW. The primary change made was 
conversion of the three electric chillers to natural gas. 
The air handler motors were also being replaced with 
variable frequency drives. Under this same project, 
the lab desired to install a 200-kW fuel cell. The fuel 
cell was a showcase project and cost $800,000 to 
install after a $200,000 rebate being funded by the 
DOEís Energy Savings Performance Contract 
Program. The fuel cell cost, otherwise prohibitive, 
could be combined with the cost savings from the 
other measures to demonstrate an innovative energy 
system with an overall 10-year payback. The 
installation was to be completed in March 2000. 
The 200-kW fuel cell would be connected to the 
distribution system at 480 volts and would operate as 
a base load unit. On the property was a substation       
with a 480 Volt to 40 kV transformer. The fuel cell 
had a transfer switch that allowed the unit to 
automatically disconnect if there was a fault on either 
side (lab or utility) of the system. In addition, a 
reverse power disconnect was installed even though 
the lab load profile was always above 200 kW of 
load. The fuel cell had an independent power 
connection that synchronized the fuel cell to the grid. 
With regard to the reverse power disconnects, the 
system was set up so that it could be turned on 
manually following a power grid failure to supply 
power to the facility during the length of the failure. 
The manual turn-on requirement was part of the 
utility requirements in case the reverse power 
disconnect failed to work. 
Regulatory Barriers 
Backup Tariff 
The primary barrier to the project was a proposed 
back-up charge of $50/kW per year or $10,000 per 
year. At the time, the lab owned and operated a 375kW 
diesel emergency back-up unit for which it did 
not pay back-up charges. The lab requested the utility 
to consider the new fuel cell project as a replacement 
for the older and less-efficient diesel with higher 
emissions. The lab had not been assessed back-up 
charges for the older diesel and expected the same 
treatment for the new fuel cell project. The project 
developer attempted to negotiate with the utility but 
did not obtain any reduction to the tariff. 
Estimated Costs 
The utility offered a 5 percent rate reduction for 10 
years as an incentive to the customer to abandon this 
project. The tariff charges would add approximately 
$10,000 annually to the cost of the project. The 
contract for the fuel cell has not yet been written and 
approved, and negotiations continue. 
Distributed Generatorís Proposed Solutions 
Although the back-up charge alone could not stop the 
project, the project developer argued that the penalty 
is incongruous with the need for peak reduction in the 
utility territory. During the summer of 1999, the 
utility contacted the lab to request that it reduce load 
to assist in meeting the summer system peak. It paid 
the lab $0.50/kWh to operate its back-up generator 
for two days. 
58 
Utility Position 
The utility was contacted and answered several 
questions regarding its position on distributed power 
and related issues. The following information was 
related by the utility representative. 
The utility is concerned with reverse power flow and 
standby services. The utility believes its procedures 
and processes for customers wishing to install 
distributed power is well organized. The utility has a 
detailed interconnection procedure that addresses 
most situations including protective equipment 
schematics. 
The utility provides metering for customers who wish 
to sell power back into the grid. All ìsellbackî 
contracts are individually negotiated, although the 
utility admitted that this is sometimes a lengthy 
process. Customers are required to execute two tariff 
riders showing commitment to the process. 
Customers must pay standby charges equal to the 
amount of the generation being installed. The utility 
does not allow non-Qualified Facilities to sell to the 
grid at any time, but it does allow interconnection of 
non-QFs. During peak summer months the utility 
requests customers with emergency generation to 
operate to shave load; however, the customer is not 
allowed to generate more power than they use. 
Customers are required to pay for maintenance and 
calibration ìperiodicallyî (period not specified). 
Customers are required to pay for all equipment 
upgrades necessary to the utilityís system as well as 
Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) 
remote control and monitoring equipment.

Background 
A customer installed a demonstration and testing 
facility at its headquarters building. This prototype 
installation provided the customer an opportunity to 
test natural gas engines for installation at remote 
locations along the companyís natural gas 
transmission lines around the country. The 
installation consisted of two V8 reciprocating engines 
outfitted with 100-kW custom generation capability. 
The system output was reduced to a rated 70 kW 
each at altitude (5,600 feet). 
The engines were installed in July 1998 after a onemonth 
delay caused by mechanical installation issues. 
The generators were installed near the building 
service entrance and were connected to the building 
supply. The facility was tied to and dependent upon 
the grid for primary power supply. The engines did 
not produce enough energy to feed back to the grid. 
The customer benefited directly from being able to 
test this equipment and software package on site. 
Further, the electricity generated reduced base load 
energy and peak demand from the grid during 
demonstrations and testing runs. 
Technical Barriers 
Interconnection Protective Equipment 
The customer believed that the local utility presented 
opposition to the project through its business 
practices, although particular individuals within the 
utility expressed interest in its success. The utility 
demanded extensive redundancy in safety systems to 
protect the grid from these test engines. The customer 
found the expressed concerns for engineering quality 
and safety to be excessive considering the small size 
of the installation, including unreasonable demands 
for technical interconnection hardware and re-testing 
of proven equipment. For example, the utility initially 
requested that the customer place a relay in the 
generatorsí neutral circuit to protect against overvoltage. 
The length of the neutral conductor between 
the engines and the building (300 feet) was long 
enough to satisfy the utilityís request for neutral 
impedance protection. 
59 
Power Factor68 
This utilityís practice with respect to power factor 
requirements varied widely from site to site. In some 
instances power factor standards were applied but not 
enforced. In other instances the utility metered the 
reactive power and charged the customer for it as part 
of the tariff or rate agreement. This could be an 
advantage to a distributed power operator who can 
set up the equipment to export VARs69, although in 
most cases the utility does not compensate the project 
for reactive power benefits. 
In this case, power factor requirements were a topic 
of long debate. The utility initially required the 
customer to bring the total facility power factor up to 
0.9 from an average of 0.86 ó this would have 
required the customer to install capacitor banks, or 
capacitors on many of its inductive loads in the 
building to correct the power factor. Although the 
power factor standard was contained in an existing 
tariff that applies to all customers, the utility was not 
requiring compliance from any other customers 
subject to the tariff, even though most large 
commercial facilities violated the 0.9 power factor 
standard. The utility nonetheless proposed to charge 
the customer for VAR demand and VAR-hours at a 
high rate specifically developed for this project and 
not on file with the Public Utility Commission. The 
developer attributed the attempt to force a high VAR 
arrangement on this project, and not on other 
customers, to a utility goal to establish a tough 
precedent for distributed power in preparation for 
future interconnection requests. 
Distributed Generatorís Proposed Solutions 
The project managers believed that no 
interconnection agreement should be required for 
peak shaving systems, given that it is 
indistinguishable from any other load reduction 
measure. The project manager argued that a 
distributed power system configured to prevent 
power export to the distribution system should not 
undergo the additional scrutiny and cost of redundant 
68 Power factor is the ratio of real power (kW) to the 
apparent power (kVA). 
69 Volt-amperes reactive (VAR) is the apparent reactive 
power delivered to the grid.                             
switchgear and other protective equipment that may 
be appropriate for systems exporting power. 
Further, it was argued that the technical 
interconnection requirements for distributed power 
can be tailored in advance to certain applications, 
e.g., peak shaving, base load, etc. Ideally, common 
interconnect standards and requirements should be in 
place for each application to allow mass produced, 
lower-cost system components. Development of 
standard system components to satisfy utility 
concerns in particular applications would not only 
markedly lower the cost of the installation, but would 
result in products that maximize system and 
operational efficiencies over the life of the system 
components. In the opinion of the project manager, 
the requirement should be for the generators to 
supply their fair share of the VARs, and no more. 
Cost Estimate 
The installation ultimately resulted in an additional 
charge of $3,000 for equipment that was considered 
redundant and a $2,000 equipment testing charge that 
was considered unnecessary. 
Utility Position 
The utility was contacted and answered several 
questions regarding its position on distributed power 
and related issues. The following information is as 
related by the utility representative. 
The utility noted that if a distributed power project is 
large enough, it may have to bid into the utilityís 
resource solicitations under a competitive bidding 
process. The utility promotes distributed power and is 
assisting the development of the proposed IEEE 
national guidelines. 
The utilityís concerns with distributed power 
installations involve protection for the grid, 
including: safety, harmonics, over and under voltage 
protection, etc. It requires specified utility-grade 
relays for large generators and type testing of 
components for small generators. 
The utility allows resale back to the grid, even by 
non-qualified facilities. In small solar cases, a pilot 
net metering tariff applies. All customers generating 
in parallel to the grid are required to sign contracts. In 
60 
addition, all facilities must install appropriate 
technical equipment for selling power back to the 
grid, even if it does not intend to generate enough 
power to sell back into the grid. 
The demand charge structure does not change if a 
customer elects to self-generate to reduce their 
demand and energy use. The utility energy charge for 
power supplied by the utility varies and it may 
change with a ìbuy all-sell allî contract in place. The 
utility stated that most customers sell power directly 
to the utility itself, but transport on its distribution 
system would be allowed at the customerís request 
with the associated uplift and transmission charges.

Background 
The Real Goods Solar Living Center (the Center) was 
built as a demonstration site for sustainable living. 
Recently the center issued the following press release 
announcing the installation of this project. Because of 
this press release, we make the exception in revealing 
the location and developers associated with this 
project. 
Real Goods Trading Corporation and the Institute for 
Solar Living announced the official launch of the 
brand new 132 kW solar power array. 
The Solar 2000 Mendocino array is the nationís first 
independent commercial solar power plant directly 
resulting from customer choice. The array will be 
owned and operated by GPU Solar, Inc. (actually 
AstroPower which is a subsidiary of GPU Solar) and 
the electricity sold under a long term contract to 
Greenmountain.com. 
Real Goods Chairman and founder, John Schaeffer, 
said, ìNot only is this project a great boom for the 
environment in its own right, it is also a very 
important demonstration effort. We expect other        
commercial developments to follow our example. 
This beautiful array, which is clearly visible from 
Highway 101, will become another magnet for 
travelers. Already 150,000 people a year visit our 
Solar Living Center, we expect many more next year. 
Further, it solidifies the community of Hoplandís 
undisputed status as the Solar Capital of the World.î 
This project is providing power to the grid. Most of 
the power generated by the project will actually be 
used by the Center; however, it will be connected to 
the utility 12-kilovolt (kV) distribution system, thus 
allowing the sale of the power to Green Mountain. 
The site installed a 132-kW DC peak (105 kW AC 
rating at standard test conditions) solar-crystalline, 
ground-mounted PV system. 
Regulatory Barriers 
Wholesale Distribution Tariff Agreement 
The most significant barriers were regulatory. Since 
this project was a test case for the utility, the 
California ISO, and the Automated Power Exchange 
(APX), procedures were developed for the first time. 
Thus, negotiating the Wholesale Distribution Tariff 
Agreement with the utility became a complex 
process. This tariff, sometimes referred to as an uplift 
tariff, was necessary to complete a contract path into 
the California ISO for scheduling. Once the power is 
scheduled into the California ISO, power can find its 
way to the retail market it was designed to serve. The 
wholesale distribution tariff was ìtemporaryî and 
subject to FERC review. As of October 1999, there 
were no charges associated with the actual 
distribution of power on the utilityís system. 
Technical Barriers 
This installation was breaking new ground in 
California. The developer believed that as a result, 
the utility was not prepared to address such a small 
installation as a generation provider. The utility did 
have a conventional interconnection agreement; 
however, it was designed for projects over 10 MW. 
To interconnect with the grid, the utility required an 
interconnection study that is still ongoing. In 
addition, the project developer paid for the service 
drop, meter, and the step-up transformer (480 Volt/ 
12 kV). 
61 
A major technical interconnection issue was the 
requirement for additional protective relays. The 
inverter equipment already supplied protective relays 
including ground fault protection relays, under/over 
voltage protection, and under/over frequency 
protection. Thus, if there were any kind of fault on 
either the utility side or the solar site side, the inverter 
could ensure that the site would automatically shut 
down. 
The utility initially requested installation of 
additional protective relay equipment that cost 
between $25,000 and $35,000. This additional 
protective relay equipment was redundant to the 
protective relays already provided with the inverter. 
After negotiations, the utility ultimately agreed that 
this additional equipment was not needed. 
Distributed Generatorís Proposed Solutions 
The project developer was working closely with the 
utility to resolve the technical and procedural 
interconnect issues. The developer was still hoping to 
negotiate a reasonable solution to the request for 
redundant relays. 
In the project developerís opinion, identifying the 
right person at the utility was critical and maintaining 
contact with the individual was also important. If the 
project developer and the utility had not worked 
together, the project would have been more difficult 
and could have been delayed.

Background 
A developer was installing a 120-kW propane gas 
reciprocating engine in a remote area where natural     
gas was not available and the cost of demand and 
energy quite high. The project was being installed on 
the low voltage side of a hospitalís own 12.4-kV to 
120/2080-volt step-down transformer. This facility 
was being charged an energy charge of 
8.69 cents/kWh and a demand charge of $5.75/kWmonth. 
In addition, because the hospital had a high 
hot-water bill, it was a good candidate for a 
cogeneration project. The hospitalís monthly electric 
bill was typically around $12,500/month and the gas 
bill was $4,700/month. Part of the electric load 
included chillers that needed to be replaced. 
The project was intended to operate as a base load 
unit. In addition to supplying 120 kW of electric 
power, the project will also supply hot water to a new 
absorption chiller and for hot water heating. The 
project allows for the elimination of a 5-ton heat 
pump that has been used for heating the swimming 
pool. With the new installation, the swimming pool 
can be heated at night when the absorption chiller is 
not needed. The proposed project will maintain this 
temperature with only 3 hours of recovered heat a 
day transferred to the pool.

Many of the barriers associated with the project have 
been technical issues that required resolution between 
the utility and the developer. The project was 
scheduled for completion on May 1, 1999. As of 
September 27, 1999, even though the inspection was 
complete, the developer had not received a letter 
from the utility allowing the unit to run for purposes 
other than testing. These technical barriers include 
the following:  
•  The utility requested a lightening arrestor that 
costs $20,000. The developer is still negotiating 
with the utility and the issue has not yet been 
resolved. The lightening arrestor is for the 
underground 12.4-KV primary voltage line. No 
other location in the state has this equipment 
installed at this time.              
•  The utility requested that a breaker rated for 2000 
amps be installed on the low voltage side of the 
transformer. The building already had 2 separate 
1600-amp breakers (for two separate feeders). 
The equipment specified has not been made since 
1982, and GE quoted a cost of $40,000 and six 
62 
months lead time. This was pointed out to the 
utility, and the requirement was dropped.                            
•  The utility stated that the high voltage feed was 
not grounded, and an inspection was required to 
prove that a high-voltage ground existed. 
Scheduling the inspection took one month. 
The utility requested a reverse power relay, even 
though this installation is an induction generator that 
requires an outside source of voltage to operate. The 
original relay specified by the utility was not 
appropriate for the installation, and General Electric 
(supplier of the relay) would not warranty it in the 
application. The utility agreed to a different relay as 
specified by General Electric; however, this process 
took an additional eight weeks. The utility required 
synchronizing equipment and parallel operation 
monitoring for the induction generator that has a 
reverse power relay installed that shuts down the 
entire cogeneration plant. This cost was over $6,000 
for equipment that the developer argued was 
unneeded. 
Regulatory Barriers 
Back-up Charges 
When the project was proposed, the utility had no 
standby charges in their tariff. During the project 
development, the utility requested a $1,200/kW-year 
standby charge from the PUC. However, the request 
to the PUC was rejected on the basis that 120 kW 
could not affect the grid. 
Business Practice Barriers 
Discount Tariff and Anti-Cogeneration Campaign 
The utility has openly discouraged its customers from 
installing cogeneration facilities and switching to 
cheaper more-efficient power. In a publication sent to 
all customers, the utility stated that cogeneration is 
inefficient and expensive. The publication points out 
ìthe heat produced by the cogeneration system 
cannot be fully utilized by the facility that it serves. 
Any wasted thermal energy is a lost opportunity for 
cogeneration units.î The publication did not point out 
that without cogeneration (with the traditional 
generating station) all the thermal energy is lost.        
The utility's publication specifically targeted the 
addition of absorption chillers to a cogeneration 
installation. A developer had recently been promoting 
this technology and had 20 installations in the 
utilityís territory. The publication stated, ìThe 
absorption chiller is being added in an attempt to use 
more of the thermal energy available from the fuel to 
improve cogeneration system performance. In the 
past, absorption chillers have not been used because 
of their very high energy consumption and poor 
efficiency. For example, a typical absorption chiller 
requires 1 Btu of energy to create 1-1.2 Btu of 
cooling. In contrast, a high efficiency electric chiller, 
such as those qualifying for utility rebates, provides 7 
Btuís of cooling energy for every Btu of energy 
supplied to the chiller.î The publication again did 
not mention that the absorption chiller uses 1 Btu of 
energy from waste heat that would not be used except 
in the chiller application. On the other hand, the Btuís 
used for the electric chiller must be generated by the 
utility and paid for by the customer. 
The utility also stated that the economics of 
cogeneration were difficult because of the lack of 
availability of natural gas. Yet, the utility was 
offering discounts to customers that did not install 
their own generation source. The utility had 
introduced a tariff reduction of 11.77 percent for 
customers who seriously considered cogeneration but 
opted to stay with the utility. The tariff required the 
customer to conduct economic analyses showing the 
savings associated with cogeneration. In addition, the 
customer must provide cost estimates from vendors 
showing the cost savings. 
At the same time, the utility did have programs to 
support renewable energy. They had a rebate 
program for residential solar hot water heaters and an 
educational program to install photovoltaic systems 
(PV) in schools. These installations were installed on 
the customerís side of the meter; thus, the energy 
generated by the PV project would only be available 
to the school. 
Estimated Costs 
The costs associated with this project were primarily 
associated with the additional equipment required. 
The additional costs included $7,000 for what the 
developer believed to be unnecessary equipment and 
63 
possibly another $20,000, still in negotiation with the 
utility. 
Distributed Generatorís Proposed Solutions 
In this case, the PUC prohibited the utility from 
imposing a back-up tariff that would have stopped 
the project. This case shows that barriers can be 
removed with regulation. On the other hand, the PUC 
has also continued to allow incentive tariffs for 
customers that stayed with the utility instead of 
installing more efficient cogeneration. (See 
discussion of economic or uneconomic bypass at 
notes 44 and 58 on pages 23 and 28.) 
The cogeneration plant developer believed that it had 
met or exceeded all interconnection requirements by 
the utility, but the utility had not yet allowed the unit 
to go on line at full output. The plant could operate 
95-percent output for testing and documentation. 
The utility did not provide a schedule when the unit 
would be allowed to operate.

Background 
In this case, an oil and gas producer with a well 
located at a public school in California sought to 
install a 75-kW microturbine and had been unable to 
interconnect the facility with the local utility under 
acceptable terms. The principal obstacle was a 
fundamental disagreement regarding the utilityís 
legal obligation to interconnect a non-utility-owned 
generating facility, which did not meet the legal 
definition of a QF under the federal PURPA statute. 
The project owner had a producing oil well located 
on the school property. The well also produced 
natural gas, which the school had been processing 
and delivering for sale into a natural gas pipeline. 
The producer hired a consultant to explore the          
possibility of capturing additional value from the 
natural gas by using it to fuel an on-site electric 
generating facility to power the oil derrick and to use 
residual heat from the generating facility for space 
and water heating at the school. 
The energy project developer contracted with the 
school to install a 75-kW microturbine on the school 
property, in part to allow both the project developer 
and the manufacturer to gain operational experience 
with this relatively new product. The project 
developer planned to operate the facility, with the 
entire output of the microturbine going directly to 
meet the oil derrickís electrical loads. Because the 
derrickís electricity demand of approximately 
1,000 kW is larger than the microturbineís 75-kW 
generating capacity, none of the electricity generated 
would be delivered to the utility. Assuming that the 
microturbine was operating at a 95-percent capacity 
factor, it would produce approximately 52,000 kWh 
per month, with a value (assuming retail prices of 
$0.10 per kWh) of approximately $5,200 per month. 
The project was installed in July 1999 and operated 
briefly to ensure operational readiness. The project 
was then shut down because the project developer 
had been unable to negotiate an acceptable 
interconnection agreement with the local utility. As 
of September 1999, the project remained stalled 
because no agreement had been reached. 
Regulatory Barriers 
Utility Prohibition to Interconnection 
The project developer stated that recent changes in 
California law opened the way for the 
interconnection of non-QF as well as QF generation 
and that the utility publicly had stated there was "no 
problem" with interconnecting to the utility. 
However, the utility refused to interconnect, arguing 
that it had no legal obligation to do so. The utility 
interpreted its obligations to interconnect non-utilityowned 
generating facilities as being limited under the 
federal PURPA statute to QFs, which included 
facilities powered by renewable resources such as 
sun, wind, and water and cogeneration facilities. 
Because this microturbine did not meet these criteria, 
the utilityís position was that it had no obligation to 
interconnect the facility to operate in parallel with the 
utility. 

64 
The project developerís response to the threshold 
question of an obligation to interconnect was that 
PURPA QF requirements apply only to facilities that 
are exporting power to the utility and not to facilities 
that are merely offsetting on-site loads and will never 
produce excess power, for sale or otherwise. In 
effect, the project developer argued that the facility 
was a ìload reduction deviceî that was functionally 
indistinguishable from any other variable loads on the 
customerís property, over which the utility has no 
control. Having met legitimate safety and power 
quality requirements, the customer argued it was 
legally entitled to interconnect a generating facility to 
manage its load and partially supply its own 
electricity needs. 
Following the initial legal dispute on the right to 
connect, the utility offered to interconnect the project 
under a new version of its Rule regarding parallel 
generation by non-utility, non-QF facilities. The Rule 
required projects to purchase standby power under a 
Schedule S. When subsequent review of Schedule S 
showed that it also required the project to be a QF, 
the utility acknowledged the inconsistency and 
offered to approach interconnection through a 
simplified regulatory proceeding called an ìadvice 
letter filing.î 
When the project developer requested the advice 
letter, the utility responded that the project was 
determined to have substantial ìrevenue impacts.î 
Management decided not to submit an advice letter 
filing until the revenue impacts could be resolved to 
its satisfaction. 
Pressed by the project developer, the utility offered to 
interconnect under an ìexperimentalî or ìtestî 
interconnection agreement, which allowed the 
parallel operation, but without compensation for 
electricity delivered to the utility. All of the 
electricity generated would be delivered to the utility 
without payment or other compensation, while the 
facility purchased all of its electricity from the utility 
at standard retail rates. This proposal would result in 
the project developer incurring all the capital and 
operating costs of operating the facility and none of 
the economic benefit.                             
Operational Requirements: Independent System 
Operator (ISO) Requirements 
The project developer noted that under existing rules 
in California, distribution-level generators have no 
way to wheel power to the ISO responsible for 
coordination and dispatch of power under retail 
competition in California. This is reflected in the 
contracts that the utility proposed, which specified 
that the utility would not wheel power on behalf of 
the project. The project developer suggested that the 
California ISO may itself be looking at solutions to 
this issue, but that at this time there are none. 
Business Practice Barriers 
Interconnection Studies 
During negotiations on interconnection, the utility 
also indicated that it would require the project 
developer to pay for a method of service study 
required for all non-utility generating facilities except 
those specifically exempt70. The utility did not 
provide a fixed price quote for conducting the study, 
which is to evaluate the impacts and modifications 
posed by the proposed interconnection. The 
minimum charge for the study is $500. This utility 
has charged as much as $50,000 for such studies in 
other cases, taking up to six months to complete. The 
project developer anticipated $50,000 as the cost of 
the study for a project of this size, but because the 
utility did not provide any further estimate, there was 
no way to plan for or challenge the cost. The utility 
informed the project developer that the cost of the 
study is non-negotiable, and that the project 
developerís only option, if unwilling to pay for the 
study, would be to abandon the project. 
The project developer argued that a study intended to 
determine whether the distribution system could 
accommodate power being delivered by the 
generating facility was unnecessary and inappropriate 
for a generating facility designed merely to reduce or 
offset the customerís own loads. The system would 
never export any power to the utility system. The 
utility, nonetheless, declined to negotiate. 
70 Small solar and wind facilities qualify for 
interconnection under the California net metering law, 
which prohibits the pass-through of such costs. 
65 
Contractual Requirements for Interconnection 
The utility's proposed contract to the project 
developer was a 43-page commercial contract that the 
project developer characterized as ìonerousî and 
overly complex for a generating facility of the size 
and scope involved. 
Processing Requests for Interconnection 
The project developer complained about the utilityís 
failure to designate a particular employee or a single 
office to act as the point of contact for the project. 
The project developer stated, ìWiggling your way 
through these rules and tariffs is a non-trivial exercise 
because the tariff office, the business office, and the 
billing office all have different interpretations 
regarding the requirements.î 
Technical Barriers 
Safety and Power Quality Requirements 
The turbine manufacturer provided the utility with 
written documentation of the results from tests of the 
protective functions of its microturbine, including 
safety and power quality features. The utility 
declined to accept the tests and indicated that it 
would perform its own tests of the equipment at the 
project developerís expense. 
In addition, the utility indicated that it would not 
accept its own testing of a single microturbine as a 
ìtype testî for prequalification and acceptance of 
other microturbines of the same make and model 
from the manufacturer. Instead, the utility indicated 
that it would require individual testing of each unit. 
The project developer characterized the utility as 
more accepting of the protective equipment used for 
synchronous and inductive generators, because these 
requirements were well defined under rules for 
PURPA QFs. The project developer noted that the 
utilities were less comfortable with generators (such 
as the microturbine in this case) that connect through 
an inverter. According to the project developer, 
inverters have the protective functionality to 
disconnect in response to abnormal utility conditions. 
For instance, a short circuit in the distribution system 
can be exacerbated by a synchronous generator, but 
not by an inverter-coupled generator that              
automatically shuts down under short-circuit 
conditions. The project developer noted that this 
ìinherent functionalityî was not yet generally 
accepted by utilities, except where national standards 
have been developedósuch as in small PV 
installations. The developer argued that incorporation 
of the built-in protective functions was part of the 
competitive economics of the facility, and the project 
could not economically justify the cost of additional, 
redundant protective equipment. 
Distributed Generatorís Proposed Solutions 
The project developer and microturbine manufacturer 
suggested several solutions to overcoming the 
barriers encountered in this project. 
The project developer favored the development of 
national standards to address legitimate safety and 
power-quality issues. Once ìeveryone agrees that 
IEEE/UL has the ability to define, test, and approve 
equipmentî the utility could not require additional 
testing of certified models, much less testing of 
individual units. 
The project developer favored quick connection for 
generating facilities that do not export power to the 
utility system. Facilities studies, such as the Method 
of Service Study in this case, are not necessary and 
should be prohibited as a delaying tactic for systems 
that merely reduce the customerís demand. These 
systems can have no adverse effect on distribution 
system capacity. 
Moreover, for cases where power is exported and a 
facilities study may be appropriate, there should be 
some way to categorize and standardize the approach 
based on generation size, voltage level, etc., so as to 
avoid the expense, time, and inconsistency of custom 
engineering studies. As the project developer noted, 
ìevery distribution engineer has a different 
perspective and they consider it more of an art than a 
science.î The case-by-case approach does not allow 
for standardized systems and prevents the emergence 
of commercial markets for customer-owned 
equipment. 
The microturbine manufacturer argued for the need to 
ìtake the interconnection decision out of the hands of 
the monopoly utility, who sees this customer as a 
competitor.î The manufacturer favored legislation to 
66 
create a fair market, perhaps by requiring the 
appointment of an independent arbiter to decide what 
facilities can be interconnected and under what terms 
and conditions. The manufacturer described the 
process as ìfighting a huge machine ó with 
thousands of engineers, thousands of lawyers ó with

Background 
A developer of solar projects installed a 43-kW solar 
photovoltaic project that was brought on line on 
April 22, 1999. It was connected to the customer's 
side of the utility grid. The solar panels were a flatroof 
design and were grid connected without battery 
storage. The purpose of the project was to sell power 
into the grid to be marketed as green energy. 
The project only supplied one to two percent of the 
customerís energy; however, the customerís goal was 
to install similar projects at all facilities, making a 
significant addition to the amount of installed solar 
capacity on the grid. In addition, the customer 
expected a capacity benefit because it was a 
commercial account and hopes to reduce the peak 
demand charges. 
Another solar project, not yet installed, will provide 
300 kW of green power to customers in the region. 
This project will be unique in that it will be installed 
at a landfill site where methane gas will be used to 
power a gas turbine that currently provides power to 
the utility distribution system. The solar panels will 
be installed on land that is no longer in use by the 
landfill site; an added benefit of the project is the 
productive use of the landfill site. 
This solar project will be connected to the grid using 
the electrical interconnection capability of the 
landfillís existing gas-to-electricity project. 
Essentially, the solar project will piggyback on the 
existing landfill project to avoid new interconnection 
issues. The landfill project is operated under a 
PURPA contract with excess interconnection 
capability at this generation site. Using the existing 
connection, the new project will avoid several utility    
interconnection issues. Instead, this project has been 
delayed due to a lack of financing. 
Business Practice Barriers 
Procedural Requirements for Interconnection 
The project developer initially intended to install the 
solar rooftop project so that power could be delivered 
to the utility grid. This would allow the marketing of 
green energy and the ability to provide more green 
energy through repeated installations. However, with 
the rooftop solar project, the costs to connect to the 
grid side of the utility meter would have been 
prohibitively expensive. The utility did not appear to 
be familiar with the idea of small generators selling 
back into the grid, and required engineering 
evaluation and consulting response. The developer 
calculated preliminary estimates on the cost to 
connect to the utility side of the grid at $30,000 to 
$40,000 (or $700 to 930/kw). 
The developer decided that the size of the project did 
not warrant the paperwork, time and expense to 
proceed with the risks of a test case for the utility. 
Primarily, the cost would have been the employees' 
time, but the developer was also concerned that the 
process could have easily been stopped by expensive 
equipment requirements. This opinion was based on 
the developerís own experience and that of others in 
the industry with experience dealing with utilities in 
the region. The business decision was that the 
potential cost of interconnection procedures would be 
prohibitive. If the project were larger, the anticipated 
cost of the process may have been warranted. 
Even without connecting to the utility grid, an 
interconnect agreement was required to install the 
unit on the customer side of the meter. The original 
interconnect agreement provided by the utility was 
written for generators larger than 1 MW. It was quite 
extensive and the developer refused to sign. After 
discussions with the utility for two months, the 
developer signed a streamlined and simplified 
interconnect agreement. The developer felt that most 
of the difficulty appeared to result from the utilityís 
lack of experience in dealing with small generators. 
68 
Estimated Costs 
The customer paid an interconnection application fee 
of $250, or $5.81/kW on the 43-kW project. The 
developer calculated preliminary estimates on the 
cost to connect the rooftop facility to the utility side 
of the grid at $30,000 to $40,000 ($698/kW to 
$930/kW) in custom engineering and consulting fees. 
Distributed Generatorís Proposed Solutions 
To expedite interconnection, utilities must establish a 
simple procedure that allows for small generation 
projects to be connected to the gridóanalogous to 
what has been done in the net-metering rules.71 The 
interconnect agreement provided by Eastern Utilities 
in Rhode Island to meet the needs of smaller 
generators could be used as a template for other 
utilities. 
Utility Position 
The utilityís basic concern with distributed power 
was that when its system trips, it wants to ensure that 
the distributed power installation also trips in order to 
ensure that islanding does not occur. If islanding does 
occur, the utility does not have control over the 
frequency and voltage that the distributed power 
installation would provide to the grid. Thus, the most 
important equipment is under/over frequency and 
under/over current protection. In addition, a 
grounded-Y source is also important. The utility does 
allow sale back into the grid if the unit is a 
Qualifying Facility under PURPA.

71 A utility in Rhode Island has a one-page interconnect 
agreement that developers are providing to utilities as a 
template for small generator interconnect agreements. The 
Texas PUC has developed a simple five-page 
interconnection agreement for distributed generating 
facilities.                                            
Background 
In this case, a farmer in Minnesota interconnected a 
35-kW wind turbine to his local utility (a rural 
electric cooperative) and has been obligated to pay a 
substantial monthly fee to the utility. The principal 
obstacle is the expense associated with the utilityís 
ìtransformer feeî of $50 per month. 
The project was installed and began operation in 
1992. The purpose of the installation was to reduce 
the farmerís electricity bills by offsetting the farmerís 
energy purchases and selling any excess energy to the 
utility during several months of the year when the 
turbine produces more energy than the farm 
consumes. 
The project owner believed that the utility had been 
extremely uncooperative. The customer further 
concluded that the utilityís purpose was to avoid 
state-mandated interconnection if it could find a way 
to do so. He reported that the utility was slow to 
respond to requests and otherwise discouraging, with 
the apparent purpose of discouraging the project. 
Business Practice Barriers 
Transformer Fees 
The utility charged farm customers a monthly 
"transformer fee" of $50, which was in effect, a 
minimum monthly bill. According to the farmer, 
other farm customers who do not self-generate 
electricity inevitably had more than $50 per month in 
electricity usage charges, so the $50 minimum 
"transformer fee" did not affect them. The farmer, 
however, indicated that he produced a net surplus of 
power during three or four months of the year and 
during those months the utility charged him the $50 
fee. Thus, the farmer has no incentive to generate 
enough electricity to offset the last $50 worth of 
electricity he used, because he derives no economic 
benefit from doing so. 
Interconnection Fees 
The utility also required the customer to pay 
approximately $250 for an additional meter to 
separately track the energy delivered by his wind 
turbine to the utility. The utility requested the 
customer to install a load meter at the generator to be 
69 
sure that the customer did not exceed the 40 kW cap 
on net metered facilities in his state. The customer 
refused to pay the cost of the additional meter, and 
the utility allowed the interconnection without the 
meter. 
Distributed Generatorís Proposed Solutions 
The customer believed that effective operation of 
interconnection laws will require a specified contact 
at the PUC who knows the rules regarding 
interconnection and can drive utilities to abide by 
them. The laws must be very simple in order to 
prevent parties from manipulating the provisions. The 
customer believes that he had no one to turn to when 
the utility attempted to make interconnection 
difficult. 
3.3 Individual Case Study Narratives for 
Small Distributed Power Projects 
(25 kW or Smaller) 
The case studies included in this size category cover 
solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, wind turbine 
generating facilities, and one PV/propane system. 
They vary in size from 300 Watts (0.3 kW) to 25 kW. 
The distributed power facilities in this size range are 
residential, commercial, agricultural, and institutional 
customers. The only technologies readily available 
commercially are PV and wind systems72, although 
some micro-cogeneration units are in limited use, and 
fuel cells in this size range are expected to be 
commercially available within a few years. 
Because of the relatively small amounts of electricity 
being produced, small distributed power facilities are 
particularly vulnerable to interconnection 
requirements that increase the costs of 
interconnecting and operating their facilities, even if 
these costs seem modest. The following is a 
description of the issues most frequently identified by 
small distributed power projects as barriers to 
interconnection. 
This section of the report provides the more 
significant case studies. These eight cases were 
chosen from the 19 cases as a representative cross

Background 
In this case, a community college in Maryland 
decided to install a large PV system on the roof of a 
college building. The system included 25 kW of thinfilm 
PV modules and eight series inverters. These 
inverters were UL listed and complied with the IEEE 
P929 standard. The college sought to interconnect the 
system to the local investor-owned utility. The 
pivotal barrier encountered was the utility's delays in 
processing of the customerís request for 
interconnection. The customer also had to deal with 
multiple utility representatives. 
Business Practice Barriers 
Processing Requests 
According to the system integrator, the utilityís 
response to the request for interconnection was ìfive 
different people asking the same questions at 
different points in time.î The utility originally 
required a test of the inverter safety functions, at 
which utility engineers would be present. The test 
procedure was set up at a substantial expense to the 
system integrator. Then the utility reported that 
because the system would never produce excess 
70 
power for delivery to the utility grid, no test was 
necessary. 
Moreover, the system integrator reported that the 
utilityís ìlocal representatives, front office people, 
and distribution engineers all ask the same questions 
regarding the same system, and all give conflicting 
answers to the installerís questions.î When the 
system integrator moves on to another site in the 
same or a different utilityís service territory, he states 
that it is ìdÈj‡ vu all over again.î

The system integrator spent approximately 100 hours 
working with various utility representatives 
negotiating and responding to interconnection 
requirements. The system integrator charged $50 per 
hour for his time, so the economic loss was 
approximately $5,000. The system integrator was 
unable to offer a reliable estimate of the time spent 
by the community college or the utility on the 
project, although he indicated that the time spent by 
these other parties also was substantial. 
Distributed Generatorís Proposed Solutions 
The system integrator suggested that the customers 
should be able to say to the utility, ìthereís a law that 
says what the interconnection standard is. I am in 
compliance with that law and those standards. I 
therefore have a right to interconnect. I am not going 
to answer a dozen phone calls from five different 
people or conduct redundant and unnecessary tests 
for your benefit.î

Background 
In this case, a residential customer in Ohio sought to 
install an 18-kW wind turbine and a 
2-kW PV system and encountered ìresistanceî from     
the local utility. Overcoming the utilityís resistance 
and obtaining interconnection required approximately 
200 hours of the customerís time and approximately 
$6,500 in attorney and expert fees. It also caused a 
delay of nearly 12 months.

Processing Requests 
In August 1994, the customer met with the utility and 
was told that the utility had never heard of the idea of 
interconnecting such a system to the grid and that it 
did not think he should do so. An attorney, a 
consumer representative, an engineer, and a power 
plant engineer represented the utility at the meeting. 
The utility declined the customerís request to 
interconnect. The customer told the utility that 
Congress had said that he was allowed to

The utility wanted the customer to pay for a separate 
meter, transformer, and power pole. The customer 
responded that he was being penalized for installing 
the generating equipment and that if he were simply 
building the residence and business the utility would 
pay for this equipment. After continued negotiations, 
the utility agreed to provide these distribution 
facilities at no cost to the customer. 
Distributed Generatorís Proposed Solutions 
The customer believed that the utilityís attitude and 
the interconnection requirements it imposed 
encouraged people to interconnect systems to the 
utility grid without informing the utility. 
The customer suggested that the utility should offer, 
ìone-stop shoppingî for distributed power. 
According to the customer, ìThey are in the business. 
They should make it easy and make money off of it. 
They should sell and install the equipment.î

Background 
In this case study, a residential customer in Illinois 
sought to install a 17.5-kW wind turbine and inverter. 
The customer encountered what he believed to be 
overly complicated interconnection requirements, 
extensive protective equipment requirements, 
expensive interconnection fees, and utility delays. 
The project was installed in 1993. 
Business Practice Barriers 
Interconnection Agreement 
The utilityís initial response to the customerís inquiry 
regarding interconnection was to send him             
information and a list of contacts of other customers 
who had experienced problems with wind 
technology. After 3 to 4 weeks, when it became clear 
that the customer still wanted to move forward, the 
utility sent the customer 37 pages of information 
including ìUtility Requirementsî that the customer 
and the customerís electrical engineer found 
incomprehensible. The package sent by the utility 
also included an electric service contract and a 
parallel operations contract. 
Interconnection Fees; Other Charges 
The utility required a $300 engineering service fee. 
The customer paid the $300 engineering fee, and sent 
a schematic for the inverter to the utility. The utility 
approved the application after a delay of 
three months. 
The customer paid the utility 10.5¢/kWh for 
electricity, and was paid 1.1¢/kWh for the excess 
electricity the utility buys back. The customer 
complained about the failure of the utility to 
recognize the higher value of electricity generated 
from a renewable resource, and the higher value of 
electricity generated close to where it is needed 
(which avoids line losses). 
The utility charges approximately $2.50/month for 
meter rental and a small additional fee for reading 
the meter. 
Making Contact 
The customer reported that it was very difficult to 
reach the utility engineer and the customerís phone 
calls often were not returned. As described by the 
customer, after the system was installed, the utility 
sent ìthree van loads of engineers and a car load of 
72 
three months. The electricity generated by the wind 
turbine produced energy savings of approximately 
$120 per month. Therefore, the delays in installation 
caused an economic loss to the customer of 
approximately $360. The $300 engineering fee 
caused the customer to lose approximately 20 percent 
of the first yearís energy savings. Since the 
installation was completed, the customer has had no 
problems with the utility. 
Technical Barriers 
Safety and Power Quality Requirements 
The utility required expensive manual and automatic 
disconnect breakers, synchronizing relays, voltage 
transformers, an under/over voltage relay, and an 
under/over frequency relay. 
The customer spoke with his wind turbine supplier, 
who had a representative contact the utility regarding 
the features and performance characteristics of the 
inverter. The utility then rescinded most of these 
requirements. 
Distributed Generatorís Proposed Solutions 
The customer believed that the utilityís negative 
attitude encouraged customers to interconnect 
without contacting their utility. He also believed that 
the utility mindset on these systems is resistance not 
cooperation. To facilitate the process in the future, 
the utility needs a staff person whose responsibility it 
is to understand and expedite requests for 
interconnection.

Background 
In this case, a residential customer in California 
purchased and installed a 10-kW PV system, 
including 40 modules and 2 sine wave inverters. The 
inverters were UL listed and complied with the IEEE    
P929 standard. The local investor-owned utility 
cooperated with the customer, requiring only two 
things: (1) A ìhold harmlessî document from the 
customerís insurance company and (2) a visible, 
lockable disconnect switch. The customer provided 
both and proceeded with the installation of the 
system. The utility sent an engineer for the final 
utility inspection. The inspector had been involved 
with two previous PV inspections. He verified that 
the inverters were as specified, checked for the 
lockable disconnect, and approved the system for 
interconnection. 
This case illustrates the extent to which the process 
can be streamlined and simplified with the full 
implementation of the California net metering law. 
As recently as six months before this customer 
sought to interconnect his system, other customers 
with similar generating facilities reported substantial 
difficulties in obtaining prompt, efficient 
interconnection with this same utility. 
Moreover, it should be noted that eligibility for net 
metering in California is limited to residential and 
small commercial customers with solar and small 
wind generators under 10 kW. We found that 
distributed generators that are not eligible for net 
metering are still frequently encountering substantial 
problems in seeking prompt, efficient interconnection 
of their systems. 
Nevertheless, cases like this one in which customers 
are reporting few, if any, problems in obtaining 
interconnection are becoming more common in this 
size subcategory of distributed generators. We are 
optimistic that substantial progress is possible in 
addressing and overcoming the problems identified 
by other distributed generators in different 
jurisdictions. 
Distributed Generatorís Proposed Solutions 
No solutions are needed. The system integrator stated 
that the utility was cooperative and that the only 
problems seemed to be related to the utilityís 
ìlearning curve.î

Background 
This case involved a residential customer in New 
England who sought to install a 3-kW PV system, 
consisting of PV modules and three inverters, which 
were UL listed and complied with the IEEE P929 
standard. The customer encountered a variety of 
technical, contractual, financial, and procedural 
barriers. The project was installed in 1999 after an 
eight-month delay. 
In late 1997, the customer had received a flier in the 
mail from the utility stating that utility customers 
could interconnect renewable energy systems with a 
capacity of 10kW or less under the utilityís net 
metering policy. The customer assumed that because 
the utility was advertising the service that 
interconnection would be straightforward. 
Business Practice Barriers 
Engineering Reviews; Insurance Requirements 
When the customer contacted the utility, he was 
informed that the utility required the following: (1) 
an engineering study by utility engineers; (2) a 
detailed engineering plan; and (3) that the utility be 
listed as an additional insured on the homeownerís 
policy. The customer responded that these 
requirements were ìridiculous.î He stated that 
residential customers who own combustion 
generators were not required to meet any of those 
requirements and asked why PV owners should be 
held to a different standard. The utility responded that 
it was because the utility was unable to keep track of 
residential customers that owned and operated 
combustion generators. The customer continued to 
argue against these requirements, and the utility 
rescinded the requirements.                        
Interconnection Fees 
The customer was told that the utility required $1,000 
to cover the costs of the customerís interconnection. 
The customer refused, again arguing that this was not 
a requirement placed on customers with generators. 
The utility rescinded its request. 
Processing Requests for Interconnection and 
Conducting Inspections 
The customer was informed that the utility required a 
site visit and a site review. Again the customer 
argued that this requirement was not imposed on 
homeowners that operate combustion generators. The 
utility dropped the requirements. 
Technical Barriers 
Safety Standards 
The customer was also told that the utility required a 
disconnect switch for the entire house. The customer 
agreed to install the whole house disconnect switch. 
The customer has since re-wired the disconnect to 
isolate only the PV system. The utility inspected and 
approved the change, placing a lock on the 
disconnect switch. 
In the end, the utility dropped all the requirements 
except the whole house disconnect. The customer 
reinstalled the system, and the utility inspected and 
approved it for free. The utility requested signage that 
identified the disconnect switch. The only cost to the 
customer (not-including the PV system) was the 
disconnect switch, the paperwork, and a $50 
interconnection fee. 
The customer stated that it took approximately 40 
hours of his time over eight months to overcome the 
barriers he encountered. The customer was unable to 
generate approximately 2,500 kWh because of the 
delays in installing the system. At 14¢/kWh, the 
delays cost approximately $350.\ 
Distributed Generatorís Proposed Solutions 
The customer stated that, to his knowledge, his was 
the first renewable energy system that had been 
interconnected to his local utility. 
74 
The customer believed that the cumbersome 
interconnection procedures required by the utility 
was encouraging customers to install systems without 
utility notification or approval. This potentially could 
result in the installation of equipment that does not 
meet appropriate safety and power quality 
requirements. 
The customer suggested that a superior solution 
would be to use a one-page interconnection 
agreement and a $50 fee to recover the utilityís cost 
to review the agreement.

Background 
In this case, a residential customer in California 
sought to install a 3-kW PV system and encountered 
numerous utility barriers. The principal obstacle was 
the utilityís lack of familiarity with the 
state-mandated interconnection process established 
under the stateís net metering law. This lack of 
familiarity resulted in the utility imposing 
requirements on the customer that it later had to 
rescind. The project was installed in the fall of 1998. 
Business Practice Barriers 
Making Contact; Processing Requests 
The customer had difficulty locating the proper 
contact person at the utility. Once the customer found 
the correct utility contact person, it seemed that the 
utility had no experience with interconnection of 
systems eligible under the California net metering 
law, which had been in place since 1996. The 
customer also reported the utility to be 
uncooperative. 
Negotiating interconnection with the utility 
ultimately took approximately 5 months.              
Interconnection Fees 
The utility initially requested an ìinstallation feeî of 
$776.80. The customer suggested that the fees were 
excessive and perhaps even punitive (based on how 
the customer understood other California utilities to 
be handling interconnection of facilities eligible for 
net metering). On request, the utility itemized the fee 
as follows: 
Materials   $344.96   Bare meter and purchasing 
and warehouse costs 
Labor     $ 64.43  Meter installation 
Equipment $ 13.75  Transportation cost for 
service truck 
Administr 
ative      
$143.87  Local engineering and 
administrative costs 
Tax 
@37%     
$209.79  The utility cites a tariff 
that states, ìAny payments 
or contributions of 
facilities by applicant shall 
include an income tax 
component of contribution 
for state and federal 
income tax at the rate 
providedÖî 
The customer and utility negotiated these costs for 
approximately 10 days. The customer noted that the 
utility interconnection agreement stated that the 
utility could install dual meters at its own expense 
with the customerís consent. The customer requested 
that option and provided his consent. The utility 
stated that it was able to install a single bi-directional 
meter and that dual metering was not necessary to 
properly bill the customer, so the customer would be 
responsible for the bi-directional meter costs. The 
customer, wanting to move the process forward, sent 
the utility a check for the $776.80. 
The customer contacted the California Energy 
Commission (CEC) for assistance. According to the 
customer, the utilityís attitude appeared to change 
after it became clear that a staff person at the CEC 
was aware of the situation and was advising the 
customer. Approximately 15 days after the customer 
sent the check for the additional meter installation, 
the utility returned the check stating that the utility 
would not require a ìmeter installation fee.î It also 
stated that the customerís existing meter was bi- 
75 
directional and would be adequate for metering the 
customerís property including the PV system. 
Contractual and Procedural Requirements for 
Interconnection 
After the utility agreed that the customerís existing 
meter met the utilityís requirements, the utility sent 
the customer an updated interconnection agreement 
and stated that the customer still needed an 
ìAuthorization to Interconnect and Operate in 
Parallelî after an ìinternal reviewî by the utility. The 
utility also stated that it was waiting to receive a copy 
of the inspection clearance from a jurisdictional 
authority (the local building inspector). The utility 
also stated that a utility representative must be 
present when the system was connected. 
Insurance Requirements 
The utility then requested to be named as an 
ìadditional insured partyî on the customerís 
homeownerís insurance policy and stated that the 
interconnection could not take place until the 
customer provided written proof of the required 
insurance. The customer was then notified by a staff 
person at the CEC (who had been kept apprised of 
the negotiations) that the utility did not need to be 
listed as an additional insured party. Instead, the 
utility simply needed to be placed on the policy as a 
ìnotified partyî in the event the policy is renewed or 
cancelled. The utility accepted this approach. 
The customer then scheduled the interconnection, 
giving the utility the required notice. 
Technical Barriers 
Redundant Equipment Requirements 
Four days later (and four days before the scheduled 
installation), the utility asked the customer to confirm 
a lockable, visible open disconnect switch between 
the inverter and the meter. The customer had installed 
a disconnect switch behind a junction box, and the 
utility did not accept this location. Initially the utility 
stated that the customer would need to pay for an 
additional disconnect. The customer complained to 
the CEC, which intervened on the customerís behalf.    
The utility then offered to pay for the additional 
disconnect, provided that the customer gave the 
utility three estimates from licensed electrical 
contractors before the utilityís approval of payment. 
The utility also stated that the new disconnect would 
need to be re-inspected by the county before the 
utility would approve the interconnect. 
The customer responded by stating that he had 
informed the utility weeks earlier that he had 
installed a visible disconnect switch and that the 
utility had not responded until the ì11th hourî 
regarding the need for something more than what the 
customer had already installed. The customer also 
complained that the utility had never before inquired 
as to what type of switch the customer had installed. 
The customer stated that he would accept the offer to 
have the utility pay for the special switch, but that he 
would not have the system bid by three contractors. 
He would simply have his existing contractor 
perform the work at a competitive price. The 
customer directed his contractor to fax the estimate to 
the utility. The customer postponed the 
interconnection, and again contacted the CEC for 
help. The utility accepted the contractorís bid and 
paid for the installation. 
The customer responded, after discussions with the 
CEC, that under current law the interconnection 
agreement that had already been approved was all the 
customer needed, provided he gave the utility five 
working days notice prior to interconnection. The 
customer stated that under advice from the CEC, he 
would give the utility the five-day notice and would 
proceed without waiting for the utilityís review 
process, or for additional approvals from the utility. 
The customer also noted that the inspection report 
from the local building inspector had been sent to the 
utility five to six weeks earlier. 
Conducting Inspections 
The customer then rescheduled the interconnection 
and notified the utility. The utility did not send a 
representative to attend the interconnection. Three or 
four months later, the utility inspected the system and 
apologized for the difficulties the customer had 
experienced, explaining that he was the first customer 
to interconnect in this fashion and that the utility was 
on a steep learning curve. 
76 
Distributed Generatorís Proposed Solutions 
The customer suggested that for the market to expand 
there needed to be broader awareness in California 
that knowledgeable and engaged staff at the CEC are 
available to respond to customer inquiries, provide 
prompt answers, and give directives to the utilities 
that are meaningful and timely.

Back-up Power Costs   Not Applicable 
Background 
This case involved a small-scale farmer in New 
England who had previously installed a 10-kW wind 
turbine on his property. He later installed a 900-Watt 
photovoltaic (PV) system on his residence in the 
service territory of an investor-owned utility. The 
principal obstacle this customer encountered was the 
technical and contractual requirements that the utility 
imposed before the customer could interconnect the 
PV system. Complying with these requirements 
ultimately cost the customer approximately $1,200, 
representing a 15-percent increase in the initial 
installed cost of the system; plus a recurring cost of 
$125 per year, representing a loss of nearly 69 
percent of the expected annual energy savings. 
The PV system was installed in September 1992. It 
consists of eighteen 51-Watt PV modules on an 
active tracker. The PV array originally was connected 
to an inverter, which was replaced with a different 
inverter. The system was interconnected to the main 
breaker panel in the residence, on the customerís side 
of the electric meter. 
Technical Barriers 
Engineering Reviews 
Because the customer also had a wind turbine in 
operation on the property, the utility expressed 
concern about the operation of two separate inverters    
in proximity. It required the customer to pay $600 for 
an engineering study to determine what safety issues 
might arise from having dual inverters on the same 
feeder. In particular, the utility expressed concern 
about the potential for the dual facilities to create an 
ìislandingî condition, which theoretically can occur 
when a generating facility is improperly energizing a 
part of the utility grid while the rest of the utility grid 
is not functioning, as during a power outage. The 
primary concern is that islanding creates a potential 
safety hazard to utility line workers who might 
unknowingly touch a feeder line energized by the 
ìislandî of generation. 
After conducting the study, the utility concluded that 
the inverters might create a potential island and 
required the installation of separate protective relays 
at a price of $600. The customer objected, noting that 
both inverters had appropriate protection against 
islanding built into them. According to the customer, 
the utility acknowledged that the inverter 
specifications ìsaid all the right things,î but that the 
inverterís protective functions were untested and 
unverifiable. (IEEE and the UL have begun 
developing technical standards for testing the 
protective functions of inverters.) In effect, the utility 
said that it was unfamiliar with the protective 
circuitry in the inverters and was more familiar ó 
and therefore more comfortable ó with the use of 
separate relays. It continued to enforce the separate 
relay requirement, and the customer paid for them to 
be installed. 
Because the relays required by the utility were 
mechanical relays (rather than the solid-state 
protective circuitry built into the inverter), the utility 
required annual testing of the relays for possible 
recalibration. The customer was charged $125 by the 
utility for annual testing of the relays. Because the 
customerís PV system was small, it was only 
expected to produce about $180 worth of electricity 
in any given year. As a result, the relay calibration 
fee offsets more than two-thirds (69 percent) of the 
expected savings from the PV system on an annual 
basis. 

77 
Business Practice Barriers 
Insurance Requirements 
The utility also imposed a requirement that the 
customer carry $200,000 in commercial liability 
insurance to cover potential liabilities from property 
damage or personal injury attributable to the PV 
system. The customer was a commercial farming 
operation that already carried commercial insurance 
in the required amount, so the utilityís requirement 
did not impose any additional burden on this 
customer. The utility also required that it be listed as 
an ìadditional insuredî on the customerís policy, 
which required the concurrence of the customerís 
insurer. The customerís insurer agreed to this 
condition. 
During the course of the conversation with his 
insurer, however, the customer learned that the 
insurer does not provide commercial riders on 
standard homeowner policies and that it does not add 
ìadditional insuredî to homeowner policies. 
Therefore, the enforcement of these insurance 
requirements could be a complete bar to the 
installation of PV systems on residential properties in 
this utilityís service territory. 
Finally, the customer reported that the utility had 
recently lifted the additional insured requirement for 
residential customers with homeownerís liability 
coverage. The $200,000 insurance requirement is still 
in effect. 
Estimated Costs 
The customer estimated that meeting utility 
interconnection requirements cost him $1,200 for the 
engineering study and the protective relays, plus 
$125 per year for the relay calibration. The customer 
further estimated that he had dedicated a total of 
approximately 200 hours over two separate sixmonth 
periods to meeting the utilityís requirements 
and addressing the utilityís concerns. 
Moreover, the manufacturers of the customerís 
equipment were called on to provide wiring 
diagrams, engineering schematics, and other 
documentation to support the customerís efforts to 
resolve the utilityís concerns. The customer was 
unable to estimate this time and expense.              
Distributed Generatorís Proposed Solutions 
The customer suggested that inverter manufacturers 
design to a particular standard, with labels to indicate 
that the inverter meets that standard, which the 
utilities would be required to automatically accept. 
The customer also suggested that part of the problem 
was the utilityís lack of familiarity with small-scale, 
customer-owned generating facilities. Some of the 
problems he encountered would be resolved over 
time as utilities gained more experience with these 
facilities.

Major Barrier         
Business Practices 
Barrier-Related Costs   $400 
Back-up Power Costs   Not Known 
Background 
This simple case involved a resident of Pennsylvania 
whose PV contractor contacted the local utility about 
installing a 300-Watt integrated AC-solarphotovoltaic 
(PV) system (producing approximately 
250 Watts AC). The principal barrier encountered by 
the customer was interconnection fees proposed by 
the utility that would have erased the equivalent of 10 
yearsí energy savings from this small PV system. 
The integrated AC PV system was one of several 
types of so-called ìAC modulesî that represent one 
of the most recent innovations in PV technology. 
Most PV systems consist of an array of multiple PV 
modules that are interconnected to the utility grid 
through a single inverter. Until recently, most 
inverters were sized to accommodate 2.5 kW to 5 kW 
of PV modules, roughly equivalent to the power 
needs of a standard residence. The price for complete 
systems of this size was approximately $25,000 to 
$40,000. Many potential customers interested in PV 
technology are unwilling or unable to afford these 
larger, whole-house systems. 
An AC module, by contrast, consists of a single PV 
module with its own micro-inverter. These microinverters 
range in size from 100 Watts to 300 Watts. 
78 
The attraction of AC modules is that they allow 
customers to invest in PV technology at prices 
starting as low as $900. Although the smallest 
systems will typically only offset a small percentage 
of a typical residential customerís electricity use 
(approximately two to four percent), they can be 
installed singly or in multiples to match the 
customerís budget and desired energy savings. 
However, because the amount of electricity generated 
by an AC module is relatively modest, the potential 
market for these self-contained PV systems depends 
on simplified interconnection at a minimum cost. In 
this case, interconnection charges that would be 
insignificant for larger distributed generating 
facilities was prohibitive when imposed on these 
small-scale systems. 
Business Practice Barriers 
Interconnection Fees 
This customer sought to install an integrated AC PV 
module in the service territory of an investor-owned 
utility. In accordance with the utilityís rules, the 
customer was provided with an application form and 
asked to submit a $100 processing fee. In addition, 
the utility indicated that it would bill the customer for 
the actual costs ìof processing the application and 
inspection of the facilities,î although ìin no event 
will the charge exceed $300.î 
These costs, which would be inconsequential for a 
larger generating facility, act as an effective bar to the 
commercialization of AC modules in the smaller 
installations for which they were designed. The AC 
module in this case, for example, is expected to 
produce approximately 400 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per 
year in a moderate solar energy environment, which 
represents approximately $40 per year in energy 
savings (assuming a retail price of 10¢/kWh). This 
means that the $100 application fee and the 
processing/inspection fee of up to $300 equals 2.5 
years and 7.5 years of energy savings, respectively. 
Another way of looking at these figures is that even if 
a 250-Watt PV system was given to a customer free 
of charge, the customer would have little incentive to 
install the system. The out-of-pocket cost to 
interconnect the system would require 10 years worth 
of electricity generation to break even, or much         
longer on a discounted present-value basis. In short, 
this case study suggests that for these small systems 
to become commercially viable interconnection must 
be essentially a ìPlug & Playî proposition, which 
will enable these units to be installed, interconnected, 
and operated at a minimal cost. 
Estimated Costs 
The cost of the barriers was between $100 and $400, 
plus time spent by customer and manufacturer 
working with the utility on the application process 
and system inspection. 
Distributed Generatorís Proposed Solutions 
The manufacturer noted that the integrated AC 
module and other micro-inverters now available on 
the market are fully compliant with safety and power 
quality standards developed for utility 
interconnection of PV systems, including the IEEE 
P929 and UL 1741 standards. The manufacturerís 
opinion was that compliance with these standards 
fully addresses legitimate safety and power quality 
concerns, and that no additional testing or inspection 
by the utility is necessary.

13. ABSTRACT (Maximum 200 words) 
Distributed power is modular electric generation or storage located close to the point of use. Based on interviews of distributed 
generation project proponents, this report reviews the barriers that distributed generators of electricity are encountering when 
attempting to interconnect to the electrical grid. Descriptions of 26 of 65 case studies are included in the report. The survey found 
and the report describes a wide range of technical, business-practice, and regulatory barriers to interconnection. An action plan for 
reducing the impact of these barriers is also included.
